A 14-year-old boy has been sent a summons, being charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, according to a police report obtained by the Herald from the May 5 incident at the McKinley Middle School. It started when the boy was trying to heat up instant ramen noodles in the microwave, and tried to put a textbook in with them, according to police. The teacher told him not to do that, and went over to take the book away — but the kid snatched it back. The teen “then stood up from his seat and threw his cup of boiling hot ramen noodles at the Victim's face,” Boston Police wrote. The teacher later told police that the noodles and water hit the left side of her face, leaving her “in excruciating pain,” with her face, ear and left eye “stinging.” The teacher went to the school nurse, who treated her and told her to seek further medical attention, so she went to a local urgent-care linic, and later told police she would be going to her doctor to further evaluate the bums. After going to the urgent care, she went to the local police station to report the incident. “It should be noted that the Victim notified the school’s principal about the incident, the principal stated that they would call 911 but did not do so,” the police wrote of the leadership of the school on St. Mary’s Street in Allston. The school’s website lists the principal as Cindie Neilson, who wasn't immediately reachable for comment. Asked for comment, BPS said this “is an unfortunate incident that took place at the McKinley, and actions were taken to ensure the safety of the staff member involved and appropriate interventions have occurred.” “Both Boston Police and the BPS Safety Services have a report of the incident, and it s being reviewed by the appropriate BPS staff,” the district continued. “Our protocol when such incidents ocour is to put in place a safety plan for everyone involved, which is currently underway.” A teacher at the school told the Herald that the incident and the response to it “really made staff upset and worried” after the principal didn't call for an ambulance. City Councilor Michael Flaherty, the council's public safety chair, said the school's response is ‘indefensible.” “I am inflamed that the principal did not call 911 after an incident of this caliber,” he told the Herald. *I demand an independent investigation as to what happened and why school leadership did not call 911 given the violent nature of the incident and the resulting injuries to one of our teachers.” High-profile incidents at the schools have made the headlines as students retumed this year, following tumultuous years disrupted by the pandemic and now with a renewed push to keep police out of schools. Flaherty and City Coundil President Ed Flynn exchanged jabs with the district a couple of weeks ago after back-to-back days of incidents at the Condon school in South Boston when a flyer with a swastika tumed up one day and then a bullet appeared inatoilet the next. ~ Last year, a student in Dorchester was accused of beating a principal unconscious. Different days have brought reports of bullets around schools, fights and threats. Earlier Thursday, the Boston Globe reported on an incident in which a family said BPS didn't call 911 when a child was having a stroke —and instead called social services on the boy’s mother after she pressed them. 911 calls requesting police to 20 Catawba Street Roxbury on April 30th 2022 at 9:01pm and 10:50pm from number] ge 118 of 251"

G. L.c.66, §10, for public records in the custody of your police department. Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must “specify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education” (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. A school-related arrest “[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.” A referral to law enforcement “[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.” I request the following public records, as defined in M. G. L.c. 4, § 7 (twenty-sixth): 1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: a. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement b. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement c. Charge (or charges) d. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement e. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement f. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement g. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement h. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement i. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement j. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. k. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and l. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. 2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each school-related arrest conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019- 2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). 3.

If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide police reports and school incident reports on each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced), per the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection for that year.

B001409-052622,2022-05-26,2022-05-26,BPD Media Relations,"Victoria Price Jan 12, Tavern at the End of the World, Charlestown, robbery Thanks! Victoria A bartender at the Tavern at the End of the World, 108 Cambridge St., in Charlestown, today recounted an early morning armed robbery in which a gunman repeatedly threatened to just shoot him as they rummaged the bar for money. The bartender told his story of what happened early on Jan. 12 to the Boston Licensing Board - which held a hearing because after the bartender reported the robbery, police cited the bar for having two customers on the premises at 2:45 a.m. - 15 minutes later than allowed. The bartender said the two men who were there past closing were not served drinks past the official closing time of 2 a.m. - bars then have a half-hour grace period to let customers finish up their orders. And they were there because he was trying to do a good deed on a bitterly cold night: The two were plumbers who had done work for the bar and he offered them a ride home if they could wait until after he had finished closing up the place for the night. Around 2:45 a.m., after cleaning up and putting chairs up on tables, he told the board, he went out back to throw out the trash. ""A man popped up, masked, wearing a hat,"" he said. The man flashed a badge that he claimed showed he was with the state Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, which also regulates liquor licenses, and said he was going to nail the bar for those two guys inside. Major violation, the ""inspector"" said, in fact, he was going to write the bar up right now. They went inside, the bartender explained to the plumbers he couldn't give them a ride home and they left. ""I was pretty upset with myself,"" because of the seriousness of such a violation, he recalled. ""I turn around, the man pulls out a gun."" He said he told the guy: ""Hey man, if you're going to write me a ticket, you don't have to have a gun out."" The guy then admitted he wasn't with the state; he was there to rob the place. And for 20 minutes, he did just that, the bartender said. With the gun pointed at him, he made the bartender empty the till. ""He had the gun at the back of my head, at one point, I felt it at the back of my neck."" But that wasn't enough; he demanded the bartender take him to the bar safe and open it up for him. Only problem: The bar didn't have a safe. ""I'm going to shoot you if you don't tell me where the safe is,"" the robber said. The bartender got an inspiration: He led the man downstairs, where he knew there was, if not a safe, a small metal box with about $100 in singles inside. As he was retrieving it, he said, the robber began ranting: ""He's holding me at gunpoint, telling me he's with the mob, that the Irish owed the Italians in Providence a lot of money, and all this 'Goodfellas' stuff."" The two then went back upstairs, the bartender with a gun to his back as they climbed the stairs. Then, he said they went out back, through the bar patio and to the corner, where the man left the steel box and then, still pointing a gun, led the bartender back into the bar and ordered him to smash the bar phone and demanded the bartender's cell phone. ""I should just waste you right now,"" he said the robber told him. ""To which I replied, I just want to go home to my dog."" Then, finally, the robber left. The bartender said the first thing he did was get down on the floor and ""serpentine"" his way to the back door and locked it - he said he was worried that if he walked there, the guy might be outside and finally make good on his threat to shoot him.

The officers state his registration had expired on May 31st, 2022. Monday was Memorial Day. This vehicle has insurance. He calls me telling me he didn't realize it expired but he has insurance cause he is on my policy. I tell him just go to the RMV website and renew it. As he is doing that the officers demand that he exits the vehicle. The last thing my son said to me was ""Mommy I need you to come, they called for Back up"". My son has no CORI but has been pulled over at least once a week by Boston Police and/or State Police while commuting back and forth. Once they exit the vehicle, my son states that he does not condone a search because their is nothing in his vehicle. They began to search all 5 boys and allegedly one of the passengers who has an ankle bracelet they retrieve a Firearm on his person. Immediately over 7 officers began to Choke all 5 boys. My son begins to shake the officer asks him why he is shaking and he says ""Because I've never been choked by the Police before"" but also choking leads to death for black young men. They take a picture of my son and take his license. They decide to ransack and tow his car in spite of the RMV website stating that you have 60 days to renew registration and that if it expired in May you have until July. His expired May 31st. Pulled over June 2nd and we renewed it June 4th. Please see attachment. https://blog.mass.gov/transportation/rmv/registry-of-motor-vehicles-extends-renewal- deadlines-for-motor-vehicle-registrations/ We renewed his registration Saturday, June 4th, 2022 and picked up his vehicle. Today we receive in the mail a criminal citation for unregistered mv and excessive tints along with his license that they kept, neither of these are criminal offenses. Today is also the last day to sign the citation to receive a hearing which makes no sense. My son gets pulled over at least once a week. I am formally requesting a review and copy of the camera footage regarding this stop as it happen directly across from B-2 Police Station in Roxbury which has cameras and Dunkin Donuts which also has cameras. In addition I am formally requesting through the Freedom of Information Act a copy of every time my son's license Plate has been run by Boston Police and or Pulled over by Boston Police. It's one thing to fight for my life as a Black Activist in this city but the constant racial profiling and harassment have to stop. I have remained silent but the exception is my child!

Specifically, Attorney Coffey found that Ayla Gavins did not comply with the legal and regulatory mandates to ensure that the needs of special education students at the Mission Hill School were being met; that she had failed to address issues regarding the appropriate use of restraints by staff and the discipline of students by staff; and that she had failed to comply with the ESL staffing requirement at the school during the 2014-2015 school year. Additionally, Attorney Coffey concluded that Ayla Gavins asked Mission Hill School staff to misrepresent the School’s delivery of ESL services and submit fabricated lists that falsely designated ELL students’ assignment to certified teachers to appear to be in compliance “on paper.” As a result of these findings, Attorney Coffey concluded that Ayla Gavins; actions amounted to conduct unbecoming a principal and that discipline was warranted based on his investigation. On August 18, 2015, Attorney Coffey issued an addendum to his June 3, 2015 report providing supplemental findings based on information he had received since issuing his original report. New information included reports from Mission Hill School staff that remedial actions and audits, and in particular, audits for the ESL and SPED programs, did not occur, that Mission Hill School frequently assigned uncertified paraprofessionals and interns to teach classrooms on short-term and extended bases, that Mission Hill School, and Ayla Gavins in particular, did not require nor encourage CPI training or maintain a restraint log, which has led to improper use of physical restraints by staff, and that staff members who cooperated with the investigation feared retaliation by Ayla Gavins for speaking with him in connection with his investigation. Attorney Coffey reaffirmed the conclusion made in his June 3, 2015 report that Ayla Gavins' conduct was conduct unbecoming a principal."

I also don't believe the dashboard distinguishes between fatal and nonfatal shootings like the BRIC stats do. I went back through the old BPD stats to see if previous BRIC reports were available but there is a gap of about 17 months between April 5, 2019, and September 5, 2020, so just included my four questions below: (1) How many shootings (fatal, nonfatal, and total) occurred between 1/1 and 6/5 in calendar years 2020 and 2019? (2) How many firearm-related arrests were made during that time period in calendar years 2020 and 2019? (3) (This is probably a question for Sgt Boyle, or for Commissioner Long if he wants to comment) What do you attribute the relatively low number of shootings in Boston to, compared to other cities? What approach have police taken recently to combatting gun violence in the city, and in what ways is that approach effective? (4) How has BPD partnered with other agencies & organizations in the city to protect residents from gun violence? Has the police approach changed or intensified at all in response to the mass shootings happening across the country? Also, if the BRIC keeps data on total number of guns taken off the streets, I'd be curious to know how many guns police have seized so far this year (2022), and how many of those were unlicensed/unregistered? Thanks, Ivy"

Specifically, I am seeking: The FY23 Title I For English Learners Budget Plans for each BPS Title I school. To help in locating these records, I can tell you that they are submitted by the schools in October-January and form the basis for part of the BPS budget presented in early February. They are usually one page long. The records I seek include the following five kinds of information: -The amount of Title I funds to be spent by each school for English learners, - A brief description of how the service/activity is supplemental, - How it will solely benefit EL students, - How it is tailored to meet the language needs of EL students, and - How it will primarily support ELD 1 and 2 students. I edit the Boston Parents Schoolyard News blog and intend to report on these records on the blog. I request that you waive fees in the public interest in fulfilling this request. The blog depends on volunteer work and has no commercial ventures. In the event that you decide not to waive fees, please provide me with a detailed, itemized, written, good faith estimate for the cost of complying, including the hourly rate and the number of hours required for each portion of the task, in advance of fulfilling these requests. To minimize costs, if responsive records are available on public websites, please provide an index of such records and the url or link to the record in lieu of a copy of the record.
