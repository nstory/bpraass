She says the attack happened on October 3. She shared the attached video with us and a screen grab of a social media account where she says these videos are being posted. The woman says she has complained about these students since the beginning of the year and that the principal, and a school police officer met to report the ongoing bullying from the same students, but nothing happened. Has BPD been notified about this by either the mom or the school? Is BPD investigating this alleged incident? Thanks for any guidance, Pete Boston 25 Good evening, I'm reaching out regarding a report of 2 cars it on fire in South Boston overnight. Could we get the information on the report?

The time period of the data should cover the earliest date available in the City of Boston and/or BPD databases through the date on which this request is fulfilled. The data should include all disclosable fields, including but not limited to fields containing the following types of information: - Date and time when the search warrant was executed - Location, coordinate, or address where the warrant was executed - Outcomes related to the warrant (e.g. whether an arrest was made, whether force was used, whether dogs were deployed, whether anything was found) - Indication of whether included warrants are “no knock,” to the extent that your office keeps this information. - In addition, we are requesting all identifiers, primary keys, and/or metadata that distinguish between unique records and individuals, and that link the database tables together, including but not limited to Incident IDs, Person IDs, and any other relevant fields you are aware of. We are also requesting any data dictionaries, code tables, or other types of manuals that define, in plain English, the meaning of the column headers in the data, and any codes, acronyms, abbreviations or other shorthand terms used for entries in the data. We are asking for an export of raw data, to the extent maintained in your databases. We do not expect you to manually input or alter any information into the data for the purposes of fulfilling this request. Redactions: If a record contains both exempt and non-exempt information, the non-exempt information should still be provided. Because we are requesting data, each distinct type of information is separated into its own field (i.e. column), making it quick to redact exempt information en masse.

We realize the information may be contained in multiple tables. We are not asking the City/BPD to join tables together for us, or to conduct any type of analysis on the data. We are merely asking for your office to export the raw data, as it exists in BPD's database, which should minimize the amount of programming ry to fulfill our request. We can do the joining on our own, so long as each table contains the unique identifiers and primary keys necessary to join the tables together, and so long as we are provided the necessary documentation to ensure that we are accurately joining and analyzing the data. We are comfortable working with very large databases in many standard data formats.

For purposes of this request, we intend “present” to mean the day that you pull responsive data to release to us, not the day this request is being filed. I believe these records are held by the Boston Police Department. If not, please direct me to the appropriate agency. We would request this information be provided to us in an electronic data file such as plain delimited text, or other file that can be imported into a database (such as a .CSV file, .XLS file, .XLSX file, etc.) This is a spreadsheet-type format. The responsive data of incidents should be a file or files on an incident-level with many fields, reported for 2019-2022. Please find the attached pdf document which outlines data fields for NIBRS, a national program to standardize crime statistic collection that the Boston Police Department participates in. Please make sure to include all NIBRS data fields and tables outlined in the PDF, along with all fields that can help us identify the specific agency that submitted the data. In the event you have certain “state statutes or offense codes”, separate from federal statues or offense codes, please provide both fields, and the table to map between the two (for translation of state offenses into federal NIBRS data). Importantly, we are not requesting your agency create any new records here – we are explicitly asking only for an electronic copy of the data your agency already has received and is in possession of. This includes all incidents, whether or not closed or cleared. But, importantly, as we are only requesting NIBRS fields, we are not requesting personally identifiable information. We are making this request as a media organization. Scripps is a major national media group (www.scripps.com ) with presence in local television, a national television network (www.newsy.com ) and in podcasts. The responsive data will be used to produce a story in the public interest and we would request a public interest waiver of any fees. If you decline to waive fees, please let us know in advance what the charge for these records will be. Should you have any questions on this matter, please do not hesitate to reach out. I'm happy to hop on the phone if there is any confusion with the request, or to aid in any way. All best, Carrie 202-657-8876"

According to ATF data, at least the following individuals and entities have held federal licenses to sell firearms in the Department’s jurisdiction since 2017: Boston Gun & Rifle Association, LLC, 1483 Dorchester Avenue Adam Phillip Samansky, One Financial Center In anticipation of any exemptions the Department may claim, I’ve attached recent rulings by the Supervisor of Records pertaining to the same request that I made to other agencies, concerning commonly -cited exemptions such as CORI, G. L. c. 66, § 10B, G. L. c. 4, § 7(26)(a), and G. L. c. 4, § 7(26)(j). I respectfully ask that you order the Department to provide me a response, in a manner consistent with your relevant orders, the Public Records Law, and its regulations, within ten business days. Thank you, Sarah Ryley Boston Globe, Reporter Cell: 347-324- 8697 Dear Records Access Officer: Under the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I am requesting the following records from the Boston Police Department pertaining to licensed firearms businesses (including individuals licensed as such), covering the time period of Jan. 1, 2017 through the date that my records are retrieved: 1) Applications for licenses to sell, rent, or lease firearms, rifles, shotguns, and machines guns; to perform gunsmithing services; or to sell ammunition; including any records during the course of the application process, such as correspondences and attachments. 2) Inspections, and any records provided to your agency as a result of inspections. 3) Referrals and complaints from any person or agency on potential violations of federal or state laws, and records of any action taken. 4) Investigations 5) Records of enforcement actions by your agency, or any other agency that are in your possession. If my request would result in a large volume of records, please send me a breakdown of the records, record types and formats, to assist me in potentially narrowing my request. I would like to receive these records in their original, machine-readable digital file format whenever possible, which I am entitled to under 950 CMR 32.07(d). (“The records access officer must provide electronic records in native form when possible.”) For example, If the records kept as Word docs, PDFs, or spreadsheets, please send them to me in that format, instead of printouts or scans of printouts. As a member of the media reporting on matters in the public interest, I am requesting a fee waiver and an expediting of my request. Since I am requesting records in their original digital format whenever possible, I expect the costs, if any, to be limited. G. L. c. 66, § 10(a) requires that you fulfill my request within 10 business days. If you are unable to furnish my records within 10 business days, you are required to send a written response within that timeframe that includes the information outlined in G. L. c. 66, § 10(b)(i-ix). If you deny my request in part or in full, G.

This happened last year and our appeal took many months with many frustrations. I realize that transportation is not managed by Eliot. However, Robbie's denial is based on the fact that Eliot is not a school in his home base which was redistricted in his fourth year of schooling at Eliot. Last year, there was a waiver form or some sort of exemption of home base communication that was sent to BPS transportation by Mr. Rubino. I'm reaching out to you requesting a copy of any communications that the Eliot School has sent to the Boston Public Schools Department of Transportation in an effort to allow Robbie bus service out of his home base. Taking on BPS transportation last year was overwhelming, mega time consuming with several phone calls, emails, and long times of waiting on hold. We were even told by BPS transportation that the only solution we had (the day before school started) was to transfer Robbie out of Eliot and enroll in a home based school. I plan on filing a formal appeal with BPS transportation. Let's hope it goes well and is timely. I will accept any insight you have in this matter and appreciate your help. Best, Stacey Minchello East 1st Street South Boston, MA 02127 cell Email received on Aug 25th Hi Stacey, Thank you so much for reaching out. We appreciate the challenging situation you are in. I have added our Senior Director of Operations, Tressa Janti to this email. She is going to meet with our BSP transportation contact and get back to you. -- Aliza Day Moschella (Kiki) Email sent on August 31st asking for an update. Response email: Hi Stacey, I hope you are doing well! We had a meeting with the Transportation Department and, unfortunately, they're not going to be able to update bus assignments until two to three weeks after the first day of school. In the meantime, you can submit a waiver here. Additional details about submitting transportation requests can be found here. Feel free to reach out with any other questions! Best, Tressa August 31st reply: Tressa, Thank you for your response. I find it bizarre that a student is expected to be without transportation for two to three weeks. I submitted ticket #58493 last week when we received the denial letter. Is a ticket considered a waiver? Are we supposed to submit a form that’s called a waiver? Mr. RUBINO submitted a waiver last year. We never physically saw this waiver. His waiver took many months; I believe it was Feb or March. And then, Robbie only received return home service; which is also bizarre. How can a child be eligible to get home but not get to school in the first place? I will be pressing our elected officials for quicker action on this matter. Also, there are other Southie Eliot students that have bus service and they live further out of district. Thank you. Stacey Questions were not answered. Public records requests: Request # 1 On September 2, 2022, I requested the following information from the BPS transportation department regarding Robert Nicholas Mallet ID#39650 after receiving a transportation denial. 1. Please forward me his records that detail this administrative override for one year only with an explanation of why it’s not two years to complete his eligibility status. 2. Please send me BPS’ re-districting policy that states existing students who were entitled to transportation will lose access to services. 3. Please explain why a bus still comes to P st and Broadway going to the Eliot but our child cannot get on it. 4. Please inform me of your name and title at BPS as your one liner denial doesn’t provide me this information. I did not receiv"

In that regard, on October 6, 2022, Elizabeth Sullivan, a press officer with the Parks and Recreation Department, wrote the following to me. As you are aware, we provided a general ledger report for the last 5 years for the Fund for Parks & Recreation in Boston. This ledger is a report generated by our financial software (BAIS Financials) consisting of approximately 80,000 transactions including deposits, payments, and various other costs related to the management of the Fund, like fees paid for the management of the investments, etc. For most transactions, aside from some of those administrative costs, no description is automatically populated in the BAIS Financials report. We can, however, provide information regarding individual payments, invoices, or receipts, as those can be looked up manually. This would be the same type of information and methodology used for the regular audits of the Fund, conducted by a third party auditing firm. In those cases, we are emailed a list of transactions and asked to provide backup. [emphasis added] We are happy to provide information and answer questions in the spirit of transparency, but an automatically generated report including descriptions does not exist. Similarly, on October 28, 2022, Ryan Woods, the commissioner of the Parks and Recreation Department, wrote the following to me. The ledger requested is pulled off of the city's BAIS financials which does not have the column filled in with any information as it is not captured by the system. So we do not have a responsive record. What I mentioned to you as you quoted above was that we can manually pull anything specific requested one at a time. In the timeline requested there are 80,000 transactions. If there are specific invoices they can be pulled. To pull all 80,000 one at a time will take months and require pulling staff off of their duties. When outside auditors come in to do reviews they ask for particular ones at random and they are pulled. That can be done. [emphasis added] Accordingly, please provide me with all the entries for donations made to the Fund for Parks and Recreation for the period January 1, 2020 to the present.

ROBERT BUCKLEY, 43, is charged with assault and battery on a person over causing serious bodily injury. Judge James Coffey ordered Buckley held on $2,000 bail, and also ordered him to stay away from the victim and stay away from J.J. Donovan’s Tavem, the site of the attack. Buckley will retur to court February 16 for a probable cause hearing. Assistant District Attorney Michael Tomasini said the victim was with relatives for a family celebration when he was attacked outside of the restaurant and thrown to the ground by a man wearing a white long-sleeve shirt and blue jeans with red underwear protruding from the rear waistband. Family members and Faneul Hall security officers told police the man, who was accomparnied by a second man, fled toward Congress Street. Officers soon located a man matching the description at Atlantic Avenue and High Street and conducted an on-site ID with a family witness. The witness told police that the man, Buckley, was “100 percent” the person who threw the victim to the ground. The second man was not involved in the altercation and was not charged. The victim was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital with a serious neck injury that could have life-long ramifications. He also suffered a severe gash to his forehead that will require plastic surgery. “It’s tragic that this innocent man is out celebrating with his family and suddenly ends up on the ground with injuries that could impact the rest of his life, and tragic that it ail happened in front of his family. Our victim witness advocates are in contact with the victim and his family and will stay by their side throughout the course of the prosecution,” Hayden said. murphy school incident Murphy school incident report.

R003476-120922,2022-12-09,2023-01-05,OPC,"Lisa Steele Steele & Associates I am assisting a Connecticut attorney with this public records request. Attorney Aaron Romano represents Mr. Gerjuan Rainer Tyus in a Connecticut state habeas case (roughly similar to a Massachusetts Rule 30 Motion for New Trial). Mr. Tyus was convicted in New London, Connecticut, of a 2006 murder in that city. See State v. Tyus, 342 Conn. 784 (2022); see also State v. Tyus, 184 Conn App. 669 (2018). There were 9mm and .380 casings found the New London crime scene. Attorney Romano received a copy of a Fax dated 12/10/09 from the Firearms Analysis Unit to “S/A Dan Prather” which included a memo from Detective Lydon, a Boston PD Firearms Examiner. The second paragraph of that memo says that “At some time during the first week of December, 2009, I was contacted by an ADA from New London, Connecticut who requested that the entire case from 2007 (FAU #07-020) be completed. I was assigned this case and proceeded to work on it.” The memo goes on to discuss the comparison between the 9mm casings submitted with the Massachusetts incident with a test casing from the recovered handgun, and a match was found. I am trying to obtain information about the communications between Boston and New London Police or the Connecticut State’s Attorney in New London, or between Boston and the ATF (which seems also to have been involved in the New London case) about whether Boston ever received or examined evidence from the New London case, or compared it to the Boston case, or lent your evidence to the ATF or to Connecticut for them to compare. If you did look at the New London evidence, or lent your evidence to Connecticut, I am looking for any chain of custody documents, notes, reports, photographs, or any other evidence that might pertain to a comparison of the Boston and New London evidence."

This office represents Mrs. Pratima Menyangbo with regards to a motor vehicle vs. bicycle accident which occurred on September 28, 2022. The video that was uploaded is just beyond where the accident occurred and does not show the accident. Our client, Pratima Menyangbo told us that she was shown a video by investigating officers after the accident, and she was able to see herself in that video. My understanding is a video of the accident does exist. Its my understanding that one of the officers was a Detective Thomas McDonough (P-617-343- 4571; Thomas.McDonough@Pd.boston.gov). The Fatal Accident Reconstruction team may also have a version of this video as well. I am writing to request copies of any surveillance video of accident."

R003627-122322,2022-12-23,2023-01-05,Public Records,"Victoria Watlington Watlington Engineering, PLLC I am a PhD student and local elected official in Charlotte, NC. I'm writing to request data in support of my dissertation research (below). I am requesting to have the data from each city by January 15, 2023. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback regarding the clarity of the request. Background To give you some context, here are the current versions of my research questions and data. Research Questions: 1. How does ideological alignment of state, local, and federal elected officials impact state and federal budget allocation (and, therefore) economic mobility across various city-state power dynamics? 2. How do racial demographics impact policy instrument selection and expenditures (and, therefore) economic mobility in large US cities? • How does African American percent of population impact policy instrument selection and budget allocation (and, therefore) economic mobility in large US cities? • How does segregation impact policy instrument selection and budget allocation (and, therefore) economic mobility in large US cities? • How does local African American affluence impact policy instrument selection and budget allocation (and, therefore) economic mobility in large US cities? (Are we lifting as we climb?) 3. How can quantitative decision support modeling be employed to improve the economic mobility budget allocation process? Hypotheses: 1. Child-focused policies that are better funded increase mobility, assuming full utilization 2. Home-rule cities are more likely to allocate and spend more on economic mobility programs. 3. When Democrat-led cities, states, and federal legislatures are governing simultaneously, economic mobility spending increases. (Will mobility?) 4. As segregation decreases, economic mobility program budget allocation and spending increases. Does mobility? 5. Cities in which African Americans have higher median incomes spend more on economic mobility programs. The goal is to then create a model that can forecast best policy portfolio selection for a local government based on the above control variables (authority, ideology, segregation, demographics, region). Data Request I'm looking for budget revenue sources (divided by federal, state, and local), allocation, AND expenditure data, by year, for FY2010-2020 for the top 50 cities in the US (as of 2020). Specifically, I'm looking for budget data for programs that fall within the economic mobility-related categories below. I understand that, for some cities/counties, many of these programs sit within the County budget. If that is the case, I would appreciate corresponding information from the County as well. For your reference, I am providing a work-in-progress example from the City of Charlotte (attached), as well as an alternative formatting example from Mecklenburg County (if possible, I would appreciate a similar format for ease of data consolidation). Examples of Investments/Programming Related to Economic Mobility Charter schools Evidence-based math curricula Evidence- based reading curricula School-wide practices Teacher training and professional development Internships and apprenticeships Job placement services Re-entry programs Sector-based skills training Transitional jobs Work readiness training Career and technical education Child wellness programs Community schools Dropout prevention programs Ged/hsed programs Mentoring, counseling, and case management School-based health programs Sexual health programs Substance use prevention programs Summer jobs Early childhood quality rankings systems evidence-based childhood curricula Preschool Accelerated remedial education programs College access programs Dual enrollment/early college programs Financial aid completion support Post-secondary academic support Post- secondary student guidance and support Post-secondary tuition su"
