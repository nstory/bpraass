I am requesting, in electronic format, all copies of timecards, or similar documents, that show hours worked, including overtime – noting the hours and dates worked – for the following officers for fiscal year 2019, including any special detail: * Mark W. Vickers Many departments allow officers to work secondary employment in positions such as security guards or for city events such as conventions where security is provided by off-duty officers. If applicable, please also include any timecards, approval documents or requests to work these or similar secondary jobs or so-called “extra duty” or “detail” shifts. Expedited processing I am requesting expedited processing. I believe this request is entitled to such processing because I am a member of the media, employed as a journalist by The New York Times where my role is primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. This request also warrants expedited processing because it seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of government activity around which there is widespread and exceptional media and public interest. These records relate to issues around police operations and financial spending, which has been an issue of national attention for the past 13 months. Police budgets can occupy a large part of a city budget, with overtime costs running particularly high in light of recent protests. A greater understanding of overtime pay would greatly contribute to the public’s understanding of this important government activity. Fee Waiver I am also requesting a fee waiver. A fee waiver is warranted because the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. I am a full-time journalist and representative of the news media. As such, search and review fees should be waived. If you have any information about this request, please do not hesitate to contact me by email or phone. I look forward to your determination. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, The New York Times welcomes an opportunity to discuss its request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, The New York Times and your agency can decrease the likelihood of costly and time- consuming litigation in the future. Best Regards, Michael Keller CiovO\"

This request also warrants expedited processing because it seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of government activity around which there is widespread and exceptional media and public interest. These records relate to issues around police operations and financial spending, which has been an issue of national attention for the past 13 months. Police budgets can occupy a large part of a city budget, with overtime costs running particularly high in light of recent protests. A greater understanding of overtime pay would greatly contribute to the public’s understanding of this important government activity. Fee Waiver I am also requesting a fee waiver. A fee waiver is warranted because the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. I am a full-time journalist and representative of the news media. As such, search and review fees should be waived. If you have any information about this request, please do not hesitate to contact me by email or phone. I look forward to your determination. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, The New York Times welcomes an opportunity to discuss its request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, The New York Times and your agency can decrease the likelihood of costly and time- consuming litigation in the future. Best Regards, Michael Keller CiovO\"

Brown Many departments allow officers to work secondary employment in positions such as security guards or for city events such as conventions where security is provided by off-duty officers. If applicable, please also include any timecards, approval documents or requests to work these or similar secondary jobs or so-called “extra duty” or “detail” shifts. Expedited processing I am requesting expedited processing. I believe this request is entitled to such processing because I am a member of the media, employed as a journalist by The New York Times where my role is primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. This request also warrants expedited processing because it seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of government activity around which there is widespread and exceptional media and public interest. These records relate to issues around police operations and financial spending, which has been an issue of national attention for the past 13 months. Police budgets can occupy a large part of a city budget, with overtime costs running particularly high in light of recent protests. A greater understanding of overtime pay would greatly contribute to the public’s understanding of this important government activity. Fee Waiver I am also requesting a fee waiver. A fee waiver is warranted because the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. I am a full-time journalist and representative of the news media. As such, search and review fees should be waived. If you have any information about this request, please do not hesitate to contact me by email or phone. I look forward to your determination. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, The New York Times welcomes an opportunity to discuss its request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, The New York Times and your agency can decrease the likelihood of costly and time- consuming litigation in the future. Best Regards, Michael Keller CiovO\"

I know Boston has 3 of these schools, and I was wondering if I could get access to the data I would need for my analysis? Specifically, I would need data (can be anonymized) on a variety of students' scores on the exam/composite score that was used for admission and any information on college acceptance/enrollment.

At that time you provided calls for service year-to- date for this area: Newmarket Square Area (RA #'s 172, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180) from January 1, 2021 - August 20, 2021. We want to look at prior years, but the data for prior years is not broken down by that RA number, so I can’t compare year to year. Do you have something already prepared that you can send me for those RA numbers but going back 3-5 years or so? I can send you a new public records request. Realistically, we don’t have time to wait the 10 days allowed, so if there isn’t something ready to go or that can be prepared quickly, I would hold off to save us both the time and effort. Kevin"

Please provide these Records in an electronically searchable format. A little background regarding this request: I requested these from Ayla Gavins in June 2019 along with the rest of Simeon's Records. When I had not received them by July, and later by September 2019, I followed up with Jenerra Williams and Geralyn McLaughlin, reiterating my request. When they provided documents to me in October 2019, they gave me a small stack of printed emails (I am estimating that it was less than 100 total pages of emails) pursuant to my request. That was all the emails that I received. By way of contrast, I requested emails mentioning my daughter Micah John in March 2021, and, once those emails were provided, I received 4,381 pages of email. In light of this, it is not possible that the several dozen emails that Jenerra and Geralyn provided to me in 2019 were all of the emails as requested, so I would appreciate it if you will provide me with all emails mentioning, referring to, or otherwise pertaining to Simeon. I know that this may be laborious, but, in light of the fact that I didn't get them when requested in 2019, I would appreciate it if this request could be expedited in some way. I sincerely appreciate your attention to this request. Best, Jeremy L. John"

McElwee To Whom It May Concern: Pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, I hereby request the following records: All records releasable that mention or pertain to the late Evgeny Freidman, an individual who owned multiple taxi cab related corporations in the Boston area. An attached obituary shall serve as proof Freidman has passed away in 2021; as such, privacy interests are diminished. Upon information and belief, the most likely source of records would be the Hackney Carriage Unit. The Freidman-tied firms known to be incorporated in the state of Massachusetts were: Lobster Taxi LLC; Braintree Taxi LLC; Offense Defense Taxi LLC. However, all records of the Boston Police Department concerning Evgeny Freidman should be released regardless of source if retrievable, as the understanding of Mr. Freidman's interactions with law enforcement are a matter of public interest. I also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage. I expect the request to be filled in an accessible format, including for screen readers, which provide text-to-speech for persons unable to read print. Files that are not accessible to screen readers include, for example, .pdf image files as well as physical documents. In the event that there are fees, I would be grateful if you would inform me of the total charges in advance of fulfilling my request. I would prefer the request filled electronically, by e-mail attachment if available or CD-ROM if not. Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation in this matter. I look forward to receiving your response to this request within 10 business days, as the statute requires. Sincerely, T.

This request is for news gathering purposes. I, or my colleagues at Business Insider or Insider, will use the records to inform the public through our reporting. I therefore request a waiver of all fees and charges pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Act. In conducting your search, please use the most recent technologies and tools available. If any part of our request is determined by your organization to be exempt from disclosure, please release any segregable non-exempt portions. If your organization determines that such segregation is impossible, please indicate why this is technically the case. If my request is denied in CiovO\"

In reality, he was having a stroke. A later toxicology report taken at Tufts Medical Center determined that there were no substances -- alcohol or otherwise -- in his bloodstream. Sgt. Thomas Carty, Officer Ismael Almeida, and Officer David Marshall arrested Elbert (Al) Copeland and held him in custody in a cell for about 5 hours before calling an ambulance.

With an abbreviated season, the season itself had only 30 home games instead of the usual 81 regular-season games. I was among the media present at the September 20, 2020 game against the New York Yankees. During the eighth inning, a man climbed into the park from the outside and perched near the camera well in center field, apparently having climbed up the wall from Lansdowne Street. The game was interrupted for 10 minutes before he was talked down. Brief press reports afterwards said he was, understandably, placed into custody. Can you let me know where I can go, or how I can access, public police records of the incident? I would like to learn more about who the man was, and how the matter was resolved. Thank you.

I stopped by that stop sign and proceeded on the right where I saw several cars stopped/made a line in front of me and several police officers speaking to folks in their vehicles. I was under the impression that there was some kind of investigation happening/maybe they are looking for someone so they are checking all cars that are passing by that street so I went by myself, without being pulled over and joined the line to wait and see whats going on. As a police officer was coming towards my car while I'm in line I rolled down my window and asked him is everything alright? he proceeds by telling me that I did not stop at the stop sign and gave me a $50 ticket attached below, saying that for this offense it's usually $108 or something like that but he's giving me a ticket of $50. I told him I did stop and he said he have it on his body camera. I asked him how I can obtain the footage of of me being seen by his camera that i did not stop he proceeds by saying something along the lines of he doesn't know I need to find it out myself or something along those lines. I called several numbers and was able to be directed to this page.

On July 13, 2021, you provided a response to the request and noted that additional documents would still be · and remain· forthcoming. Only two sets of documents, not including any communication between the parties as requested were produced. Additionally, it appears that the documents produced to date are not responsive to the specific requests contained in the January 14, 2020, request. In an effort to help move the production along to completion and in order to avoid any escalation of this matter, we have narrowed the requests to the following: 1. All records of communication for the period of January 2015 to December 2018, between the following parties: 1) the office of Mayor Walsh, Mayor Walsh, his chiefs of staff during the period of 2016·2019 (Dan Koh and Steve Sweeney), and Patrick Brophy and any employee in the office of chief of operations, and 2) Delaware Garden Development Corporation, TD Garden, Delaware North and its affiliates and its management (""Delaware North""), related to the Boston winter holiday market on City Hall Plaza for December 2016, December 2017, and December 2018. 2. All records related to the discussions and/or decisions to cancel the Boston Holiday Market on City Hall Plaza in 2017, and then 2018, and the announcement of the cancellation and renovation project on City Hall Plaza in 2018, including communications between the office of Mayor Walsh, and any employee of the City, and Delaware Garden Development Corporation, TD Garden, Delaware North and its affiliates and its management (""Delaware North""). 3. All records related to the proposals by Lena Romanova and her affiliates Millennial Entertainment Group and Boston Winter Village to organize a winter event on Copley Square in 2017, 2018 and 2019, including communications between the offices of Mayer Walsh and the department of Parks and Recreations (Chris Cook and Ryan Wood). 4. All records related to communications between the City of Boston, Delaware North, Boston Properties, Michael Goldman, Mathew O'Neil and any other third-party representative of Delaware North and Boston Properties, related to the Hub on Causeway, and/or the construction permits of the Hub of Causeway, and participation and/or the financing of the Boston winter holiday market on City Hall Plaza for December 2016, December 2017, and December 2018. The Public Records Law requires you to provide us with a written response within 10 business days. Since the initial request dated January 14, 2020, sent by Derek Moitoso, there have been e-mail exchanges between you and Mr. Moitoso in which you requested more time to respond. However, twenty months have now passed and, as noted above, all that has been produced is two very limited sets of documents, which suggests that there is resistance on the City's part to comply with its statutory duty. We trust that these more limited requests will result in a fulsome and proper disclosure and look forward to receiving a prompt response within the requirements of the statute."

The first image has a tow zone sign and 4 other signs in North End. The second has a map of ""Coord Collector Asset Data"" and the last has ""Coord Regulation Data"". I also request that, if appropriate, fees be waived as we believe this request is in the public interest, as suggested but not stipulated by the recommendations of the Massachusetts Supervisor of Public Records. The requested documents will be made available to the general public free of charge as part of the public information service at MuckRock.com, processed by a representative of the news media/press and is made in the process of news gathering and not for commercial usage.

B002240-120821,2021-12-08,2022-02-17,OPC,"Alex Marthews Thank you for providing a partial Privacy Log in response to our Public Records Request. However, there are a number of issues relating to what has been provided. 1. The Privacy Log PDF Is Incomplete Relative to Excel File You provided the Privacy Log as a PDF version of an Excel spreadsheet. As a result, the text in several cells is truncated, meaning that we don’t have all of the text we’re supposed to have. It tends to be the particularly interesting incidents, that required longer text descriptions, that suffer from this. We would like to receive the Excel file. Here are three examples of why the PDF file is insufficient as it stands: a. On of the PDF file, the text reads, in full, as follows: ""Privacy Complaint - 12/8/15 Violation Pending On December 8, David Carabin received and reviewed a letter addressed to the BRIC Privacy Committee, from [redacted]. This letter was determined to be a ""Privacy Complaint"" letter that challenges the BRIC's adherence to its Privacy Policy, and provides accusation that the BRIC has violated Ms. [redacted]'s rights. Synopsis: On August 4th, the BRIC presented at the National Geospatial Preparedness Summit in Washington, DC. The presentation was intended to share GIS (mapping) related lessons learned by the BRIC over the last several years in our efforts to provide support to BPD's special events and critical incidents, and our development of a ""Common Operating Picture"" (COP) for sharing operational information during such events/incidents in real time. On October 19, we were advised that our presentation was posted on the internet by the hosts of the training conference. We requested that it be removed and destroyed, and our request was honored. Unfortunately, the ACLU and others picked up on it, found it controversial and brought additional attention to it on Twitter. One of the slides includes a photo of our COP while it was being used during the 2015 Boston Marathon. In the photo (attached), there is a stream of information being shared, advising"" You can see that we have no idea of what follows the word “advising.” b. On page 17 of 38, of the PDF file, the text reads, in full, as follows: ""BRIC Visit Request - Digital 4th 3/6/15 Meeting Pending On 3/6/15, David Carabin fielded a phone call with of Digital 4th, requesting a visit to the BRIC for conversations on BRIC policies, activities and accountability. David advised to put his request in writing and I will forward to appropriate personnel (Legal/Media/Bureau Chief) for direction on next steps; but was advised that there are no guarantees that this meeting will be approved, as this is not a typical request or occurance. followed up immediately with his request in writing (see below), and this was forwarded to Legal, Media and BRIC Leadership for directions on next steps: Dear David, Thank you for your time just now. As we discussed on the phone, we had been in discussions with Sgt. Coleman regarding the possibility of an in-person meeting to discuss privacy and civil liberties implications of fusion center operations. Specifically, and following on from the Public Records Act response you have provided to us, we have some questions that would be very helpful to get some clarity on. The 2013 Fusion Center Assessment - Individual Report that you released to us, though heavily redacted, contained enough information to enable us to ask the following questions. 1.

Specifically, we request the following information: 1. For each officer listed in the attached Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: the unit, division, precinct, and/or barrack assignment for that officer. Returning the provided spreadsheet to us with the requested information will fulfil this public records request. We recognize that records holders are not obligated to create new records, and therefore, alternatively, we request any record, roster, or list that contains the requested information for each listed individual. With respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for “retrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.” See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records neither in the preferred form nor in a “searchable machine-readable form.” 950 CMR 32.04 (5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). If you believe that some portion of the documents requested are exempt from disclosure or require redaction, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note the specific applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted portions. CPCS is a state agency and because this request involves a matter of public interest and serves no commercial purpose, we ask that you waive any fees. CPCS is an agency dedicated to the legal defense and protection of indigent individuals across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
