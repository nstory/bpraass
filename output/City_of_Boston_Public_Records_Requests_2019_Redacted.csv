On August 21, 2016, my clients were passengers who were injured on a private bus for hire which was involved in an car accident on a public way in the City of Boston. All of my clients are low income females. On May 30, 2017, our office made a Freedom of Information Act Request, pursuant to M.G.L.C. 66, Section 10 upon the Boston Police Department, records access officer for all accident reports related to the August 21, 2016 accident. your office produced what appears to be a complete record of all reports. your initial production contained some redaction of information which I was informed made because the department had not yet decided whether any criminal charges would follow. On my follow up to the inquiries to the department, I was informed that no criminal charges have been or are expected to be filed. at this time, I must proceed with my clients' standard civil motor vehicle claims. the injured passengers were all lawful passengers on the bus which was operated by one bus driver and one bus driver's assistant. the accident occurred 2 and 1/4 years ago and time is of the essence in proceeding under Massachusetts limitations laws. in order to pursue their civil claim, the passengers must be able to identify the names and addresses of the bus driver and the driver's assistant. on one report, the bus driver's name is listed to be ""Joe Alvarez"" and his assistant's name is redacted. The address of both are also redacted. as you may know, in every civil claim, at minimum, a Massachusetts resident must be able to identify name and current address of all potentially negligent parties. Naturally, it is an important public interest that the actual involved parties are properly identified to ensure that persons who are not participants are not inadvertently identified or involved. in this case, there are likely many persons who would respond to the name ""Jose Alvarez"" without more. Standard civil practice authorizes the registrars of motor vehicles to routinely disclose the current address of all potential tortfeasors who maintain driver's licenses to inquiring licensed attorneys. however, a meaningful rmv search requires the last known name, address and date of birth of the potential tortfeasor. Tiesha Epps requests that 1. the Boston police department produce without redaction all of the reports relating to the subject august 16, 2016 accident including those I have attached to this request for your convenience. 2. at the minimum, produce all pages of the reports which identify the name, address and dates of birth of the bus driver, Jose Alvarez and his driver's assistant."

Bensten kbensten@daypitney.com -- This letter is a request under the Public Records Law, G.L. c. 66, § 10, for documents in the possession of the City of Boston and the Boston Police Department (BPD) regarding cooperation between the BPD and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The request is made on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union ofMassachusetts, Inc., and Greater Boston Legal Services. The City of Boston and the BPD have pledged to make Boston a safe place for immigrants. Nevertheless, in a federal district court complaint filed on February 27, 2019, the U.S. Department of Labor alleges that a Boston employer unlawfully retaliated against an injured worker by causing the worker to be arrested by ICE, and that this arrest was orchestrated by two BPD officers, one of them a member of a BPD-ICE ""task force."" If true, the alarming allegation that the BPD facilitated ICE's arrest of an injured worker who sought legal remedies calls into question the City of Boston's commitment to workers and immigrant communities. The requested documents will help educate the public about the relationship between the BPD and ICE and provide a snapshot of communication between the two agencies during discrete time periods. We request the following: 1. All documents relating to the creation, purpose, membership, management, responsibilities, operations, effectiveness, and/or desirability of a BPD-ICE task force, or any other grouping or designation of BPD officers who communicate with ICE more frequently than their colleagues do. 2. All documents relating to the designation and/or role of particular BPD officers as points of contact or liaisons for ICE, and/or the responsibilities of said officers. 3. All communications between Boston City Hall and the BPD regarding the BPD's cooperation and/or communication with ICE, including communications about the BPD-ICE task force. 4. Any document describing the BPD's cooperation and/or communication with ICE. 5. Any document relating to specific circumstances in which BPD or other City of Boston employees are restricted· in cooperating or sharing information with ICE. 6. All documents relating to any ICE employee's access to information created or maintained by the BPD, including through the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (ERIC), COPLINK, or any other information sharing system. 7. All documents relating to requests for information or action made by ICE to the City of Boston or the BPD (including ERIC), and vice versa, since January 1, 2019, including the responses to these requests. 8. All documents relating to Tara Construction, Inc., ICE's arrest of Jose Martin Paz Flores, and/or the U.S. Department of Labor's investigation into these matters since March 29, 2017. 9. All emails, text messages, and records of other communications between employees of ICE and (a) Sergeant Detective Gregory Gallagher; (b) any officer who is a member of a BPD-ICE task force (or other comparable grouping described in paragraph 1 of this request); and/or (c) any officer serving as a point of contact or liaison to ICE during the following time periods: May 1, 2017 to May 14, 2017, and February 15, 2019 to March 1, 2019. Even where not specifically indicated, this request includes documents that are in electronic format, such as emails, and includes documents in the possession of the BRIC or any other division of the BPD.

My Grandmother lived with her Mother and Franny in Boston, she told me all the police knew her (Mary) and her Mother as they walked the streets and they all liked Franny. My Mother told me when Franny started with the BPD as a young man and living with my Grandmother and their Mother he would sometimes not be seen for days and use the back door to come in to avoid having his mother see his face which was bruised from scuffling. My Mother had a scrapbook my Grandmother kept with numerous clippings about Franny and his partner, I think he was Frankl Callahan? I might be wrong with his name. One of the clippings was a story about a ride along with Franny, (Frank) and his partner, it detailed how Franny was a large affable Irishman Who could instantly become someone you did not want to mess with and despite his size was fast athletic & powerful, it detailed a specific story of seeing 2 men matching a description of wanted men and Franny sprung from the car and nabbed one fellow and handed him to his partner saying if he moves “deck him” and Franny nabbed the 2nd suspect and after speaking for a few minutes Franny realized the suspects were not the wanted men and Franny became the affable Irishman once more. Another story told of a time Franny was off duty and a bunch of people were running out of a restaurant yelling , it’s a robbery! they have guns, something to that effect and Franny just charged in as everyone else was running out Franny ran in and engaged the robbers who it turned out had a fake gun, the story went on to say the suspects were so beat up the medics thought they had been shot, Lol ! Another story described Franny jumping off a fire escape or something high and landing on top of a suspect who was fleeing and Franny broke his leg, My Grandmother said Franny was very tough and was quickly promoted very early in his career into a Special Services squad a group known as Slattery’s raiders, a unit of tough men chosen by Slattery who was a really tough guy and I think Chief at one time? My Mother showed me so many clippings from numerous papers over decades, 1940’s to 1960’s, so many it seemed hard to believe, almost like Franny was best buddies with the news reporters and they wrote of his exploits often and in complimentary ways. Franny had a boat in the harbor you could live aboard or take around the world. Reading and hearing about his life always fascinated me as a kid and as an adult after getting online have tried to find stories of his career and some online sites allege to have many stories whoever they have 200,000 Frank murphy’s and in the mix are some of Franny however so far I have not found many, far less than I know existed , I hope you could assist me in detailing Franny’s lfe as he certainly was a character! My Dad said Franny was the type of detective they made shows and movies about. Anything you can do to assist me preserve this interesting piece of BPD history would be appreciated"

This project is funded by the University of North Florida’s Foundation Board Initiative. We would like to ask for your help. We understand that police reports are public records, but that we need to ask for access to them and potentially pay for the copies. Could you please send us a copy of the public version of the police report related to the mass shooting which happened in Boston, Massachusetts, Westview and Stratton St., leaving 4 injured on August 21, 2016. Please let us know how much we owe you for your help with the police report and what would be the best way to pay for it. What is easiest for you to send them back by email, fax, or snail mail?"

The front end is bashed in, hood buckled, and it's smoking/steaming from under the hood.

I had contacted you in 2015, but I wanted to write again to see if I could make contact. My research considers the neighborhood rates of incarceration in Massachusetts, and I have worked with the MA DOC Research Division for the last seven years studying their admission and release records. I have also worked with Bruce Western and Anthony Braga on a reentry study. At the recommendation of Cliff Goodband, whom I have been working with at the State Police, I am writing to you to see if it would be possible to obtain data similar to those l collected from their NIBRS data. I am working on a dataset that examines prison admissions from 2009--2014 in Massachusetts. I was hoping to obtain geocoded data (at the census tract level) for 2008 for violent and drug crimes and arrests for the city of Boston. This data would mirror the NIBRS data provided to me by Cliff, and would provide a fuller picture of the distribution of crime in my data for the whole state, which currently doesn't contain any data on Boston for this year at such a disaggregated level. The State Police provided two datasets: violent incidences and drug incidences in 2008, and in the drug data, there was a field that indicated if there was an arrest made. I created a violent crime rate measure from their data using the UCR’s violent crime definition: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. I then aggregated these incidences to census tracts. I then made a measure of drug arrest rates at the census tract level. My goal is to create the same measure, but for Boston census tracts, so that I can perform a statewide analysis of crime and incarceration at the tract level. Since the data from NIBRS are from 2008, I am just requesting data from that year, and if possible, just the UCR violent crimes aggregated to tracts. Please let me know if you would like further information about the research, and what steps could possibly lead to obtaining data of this sort. I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration with this request. Feel free to call me at"

My most recent book came out last fall. Fly Girls, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, tells the forgotten story of a group of female pilots fighting for the right to fly and race airplanes in the 1920s and '30s, and ultimately beating the men at their own game in one of the most celebrated air races of them all in 1936. It is a New York Times bestseller and was named one of the Times' 100 Notable Books of 2018. You can learn more at www.flygirlsbook.com. I'm doing some research into a shooting that happened in Boston in September 1979. The victim's name was Darryl Williams. Darryl was a black player on the Jamaica Plain High School football team. And during a game in Charlestown that September, three white teenagers shot him—while he was on the field—paralyzing him from the neck down. They pleaded guilty to gun charges (they said they were shooting at pigeons; not the football players) and were sentenced in 1980. Their names were Stephen McGonagle, Joseph Nardone, and Patrick Doe. Under the Freedom of Information Act, I wanted to request to view any and all documents related to the Boston Police Department's investigation into the Williams shooting, including but not limited to case files, evidence reports, transcripts of interviews or any recordings of interviews with the suspects or the original 911 dispatch call. Can you get back to me and let me know how we can proceed? Or what else you might need from me to get started?

We are the owners of the condo association at 469 E 4th St, South Boston, MA 02127. The association consists of two condo units, ours (#2) and Loic/Emilie's (#1). The condo building is new consturction and was completed in mid 2017. It replaced a prior single-family home with a yard at that address (Erect Permit dated 11/10/2016, permit No. ERT500382). In early August 2019, we came home after work one day and found a work crew in front of our home installing a 5G cell tower on a preexisting utility pole which is approximately 5 feet from our condo building wall. The pole had been there (owned by Crown Castle), but we had not really noticed it, as it was below the line of sight from our living room window. The ""upgrade"" work done to the pole resulted in significant increase in its height and the installation of a 5G cell tower directly in front of and way too close (5-10ft) to our living space. We were not notified about any of these planned changes and when we spoke with various city officials from Mayor's office, zoning, public works, etc, we were told that they will look into this and figure out what is going on. The latest communication we received from the city was from Anthony DiBona on 9/12/19, stating that the utility pole ""upgrade"" was approved 3 years ago - which was before our house was even built. This means that whatever work was proposed to be done to the pole and subsequently approved did not take into consideration the proximity and intrusiveness of this structure on our property and lives. We have major health and noise pollution concerns about the location and proximity of this high frequency RF radiation emitter. I recently found out I am pregnant, and given the fact that children and pregnant women are much more susceptible to the harmful effects of high energy RF radiation, I feel unsafe in my own home. We would like to request the following documentation: 1. Any and all zoning/public works records related to this particular utility pole (on the corner of E 4th St and National St, in South Boston, Crown Castle Site ID: SB010). 2. Any applications / proposals to install or upgrade a wireless facility in front of our home at 469 E 4th Street (cross street is Dorchester St). We are interested in who filed these proposals/applications, sought the relief, and who approved them on the city's end. 3. Any wireless emissions/RF safety surveys or engineering surveys that were submitted to the city in support of the safety of the installation/upgrade of this wireless facility/cell tower. Attached are some photos of the pole in question. Thank you very much for your help with this matter. Please let us know if you have any questions."

I am deadline to confirm by 1/10/2020 who Case#290-919 belongs to. Any help will greatly be appreciated and TY for your attention to this matter! Please contact me at (email address: or leave VM since I am truck driver and will not always be able to pick up or contact my Translator, Ruby Tom at who will be able to translate to me in Cantonese what is needed. Thanks, Va Kuan Joe"
