B000129-012320,2020-01-23,2020-02-05,BPD Media Relations,"Mike Beaudet WCVB Hi Sgt. Boyle, We are working on a story about the Valor Act/Brave Act where veterans are able to have criminal charges dismissed if they’re getting treatment for issues related to their military service. One of the cases we are looking at involves one of your officers, Thomas Bent, who was charged with simple assault and battery and resisting arrest after an incident at the Jimmy Buffett concert in Mansfield last August. The case was eventually dismissed under the Valor Act/Brave Act. We’ve since talked to the alleged victim in the case who says he feels like justice has not been served. I am reaching out to see what information you can provide me on Officer Bent’s current status. We know he’s working because we’ve seen him in uniform, but was he off the job at any time after the August incident? Was there an internal affairs investigation? If so, I’d like to request a copy of it pursuant to Mass. Public Records Law. One of the issues we’re looking at is when police officers use the Valor Act/Brave Act to have criminal charges dismissed. While an argument can certainly be made that our veterans deserve a break if they’re suffering from mental health issues related to their service, does that necessarily mean they should be back on the streets working as officers? Does the department have any concerns about Bent or other officers who have used the Valor Act/Brave Act to have their cases dismissed? I’d also like to know how many other Valor Act/Brave Act cases your department has encountered involving your officers. Sorry to make this so lengthy. I figured an email laying out my questions was a good place to start. Happy to discuss further on the phone. My cell is 617-365-0577 Thanks, Mike"

B000138-012620,2020-01-26,2020-02-03,BAT/Hackney,"BAT/HACKNEY Stevan Johnson Commissioner Gross, This shall serve as both a (1) Complaint and (2) Public Records Request. An incident that allegedly occurred January 6, 2014 was registered as Hackney Complaint # 14-0011. Hackney Complaint # 14- 0011 was assigned (by Sgt. 8952) to Boston Police Officer Mary Dibella who at that time was serving as a member of the Hackney Carriage Unit in the Office of the Inspector of Carriages. A written Answer dated March 21, 2014 was sent to Officer Dibella via Certified Mail (7012 3050 0001 5264 8198) regarding Hackney Complaint # 14-0011 after Boston Police Sergeant Mark J. Fleming served City of Boston Hackney Carriage Driver 9312 (“Driver 9312”) with a copy of the Hackney Complaint form on March 21, 2014 indicating an incident had occurred on 1/6/14 involving alleged “credit card refusal” as payment for a fare for transportation provided by Coconut Grove Institute Cab, Inc., the owner of medallion no. 777. A hearing was not conducted by Officer Dibella or the Inspector of Carriages pertaining to Hackney Complaint # 14-0011 “within fourteen (14) business days of receipt of notice of the Violation or [Hackney] Complaint [#14-0011] at which the Medallion or Driver [9312] may present evidence and testimony” as contemplated by Section 8(IV)(d)(i) of Boston Police Department Rule 403 (“Rule 403”). Furthermore, neither Officer Deibella, Sergeant Fleming or the Inspector of Carriages has rendered an initial “written decision” concerning Hackney Complaint # 14-0011 as contemplated by Rule 403 § 8 (IV)(d)(ii), contrary to a prior instance where Sergeant Fleming and Boston Police Captain Steven P. McLaughlin conspired to “suspend” City of Boston Hackney Carriage Driver’s License 9312 (“License 9312”) for four (4) days beginning on July 17, 2013 in connection with Hackney Complaint #’s 13-0450. In response to a December 19, 2019 Public Records Request seeking a copy of the initial “written decision” the City of Boston Director of Public Records, Shawn A. Williams, Esq., wrote that “In response to [the] request, a comprehensive search was completed with the information provided in [the] request. There is no record responsive to [the] request as there was no written decision associated with this matter.” According to a January 24, 2020 electronic mail (email) communication Mr. Williams sent, which was reviewed by Boston Police Lieutenant Thomas W. Lema, Jr., a copy of the aforementioned response was sent January 14, 2020 and apparently was also subsequently “printed and mailed” per the December 19, 2019 Public Records Request. COMPLAINT - Boston Police Officer Mary Dibella violated Boston Police Department Rule 102 (February 11, 2003) by intentionally “neglecting” to (a) conduct a hearing on Hackney Complaint # 14-0011 in accordance with Rule 403 § 8(IV)(d)(i) and/(b) render a “written decision” on Hackney Complaint # 14-0011 in accordance with Rule 403 § 8(IV)(d)(ii) promulgated August 29, 2008 pursuant to St. 1930, c. 392. See Sebago v. Boston Cab Dispatch, Inc., 471 Mass. 321, 322 (2015). Moreover, Boston Police Officer Mary Dibella has violated the rights secured to Driver 9312 guaranteed to each person born in the United States, of every race and color, enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and a law passed April 9, 1866, among others, by the U.S. Congress entitling Driver 9312 the “full and equal benefit of all laws and proceeding for the security of person and property” rights vested in License 9312 as of on or about December 19, 2003.

As part of that application process, we have to record any experiences we've had with law enforcement. As a freshman at Harvard in 2009, I camped out one night with other students and activists on the Boston Common in support of clean energy. Unbeknownst to me, we did not have a permit to do so, so the police came through our camp and took everyone's information. I'm not sure what we were charged with, but I imagine it was along the lines of trespass. A pro bono lawyer represented the group and had the charges removed from my record, though I had to pay a $50 fine. Now I need to provide the bar with either a record of the charge, or with a letter affirming that there is no record of the charge. Would you be able to supply such a letter? If not, do you know which office I should contact for such a letter?"

Law Secs. 84 to 99, I write to request access to and a copy of Police and dash cam video of a police chase that occurred on Nov 20, 2018 involving Michael Robicheau, 57. Boston police said the incident started around 1:30 p.m. at the Roche Brothers supermarket on Centre Street in West Roxbury. Police said the driver was spotted by an officer illegally parked and blocking the front entrance to the supermarket. According to police, the officer entered the store and asked store employees to use the in-store public address system to ask the owner of the car to move the vehicle. Police said the driver of the vehicle came out of the store and returned to his vehicle. According to police, when the officer approached the driver to let him know a citation could have been written, the driver ignored the officer, jumped into his vehicle and took off at a high rate of speed, almost striking the officer. Witnesses said the driver hit several parked cars on the street before crashing on the sidewalk. One driver was struck as she was trying to back out of the driveway. Police said a loaded Browning 12-gauge semi-automatic shotgun was found lying on the front passenger seat of the vehicle. If your agency does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian's name and address. I agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $65. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me.

We are seeking records of an arrest in Boston that occurred on April 29, 2009. Mr. Sandoval is a Green Card holder living in Jamaica Plain, and he is applying for American citizenship. In 2009, He was arrested by officers of the Cambridge Police Department, who later released him when they clarified that the arrest warrant was not for Mr. Sandoval (I have enclosed the documents provided to Mr. Sandoval by the Cambridge Police.). Upon Mr. Sandoval passing his citizenship tests, he was informed by USCIS that this April 2009 arrest was still attributed to him via the Boston Police Department’s records. I have enclosed the page in which USCIS describes this record. USCIS claims Mr. Sandoval was charged by the Boston Police with three crimes, including assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. Mr. Sandoval was in fact never charged with these crimes. We seek further information about the arrest of Erik (spelled “Erick” in some records) Sandoval by the Boston Police Department on April 29, 2009.

My coauthor, Professor Christian Dippel, and I are researching the importance of actuarial assumptions for public pension systems. I am contacting today because we are collecting information on actuarial assumption changes in large pension plan systems. We are aware that the Boston Retirement System adjusted the Investment Return Assumption a few times over the past 15 years. It would be incredibly valuable if we could obtain the Board Meeting Minutes from the dates that assumption changes were approved. In particular, we are interested in the following rate changes: 2010: from 8.00% to 7.88% 2011: from 7.88% to 7.75% We saw that your website provides some electronic meeting minutes, but we were unable to find meeting minutes for these changes. Would it be possible to get copies of the meeting minutes when these rate changes were approved? The most important piece of information for our research is the precise date of the meeting when the rate change was decided, but a copy of the meeting minutes would be incredibly valuable as well. We would greatly appreciate any information you could provide and thank you for your time.

I understand that many of the old reports are stored in hard copy only, and I do not expect you to go through boxes to try and find the oldest one. If you can help me find the oldest one you have available (digitally scanned or previously released), that would be much appreciated. I am looking for any report(s), with the narrative, pre-1950's if you have them. The older the better. If you do not have an old police report available, I will take any other previously released report you have available. Thank you for the help. Sgt. Joshua Lee Mesa Police Department 480-298-9223"

I was arrested with Molly Hunt on August 5th or 6th at night, in 1985—it was the 40th anniversary of Hiroshima Day, and we were whitewashing the streets of Boston in a protest action for a group called PAND, a group that protested again nuclear arms. We were kept in prison overnight at the downtown facility fairly close to the restaurant Maison Robert, in front of which we were arrested, then released the following day. About a month or so later, we attended a hearing in a courtroom downtown with all the other women who’d also been kept in our pen. But the judge dismissed the entire case because the paint we were using had been washed away in the summer rains. There were about 25-30 of us, and also about 30 men who were also arrested the same night. We were told at the time that our records would also be expunged. That said, I’d still love to see if my record or photo are still on file. Many thanks!"

I attach a records request that is borne out of my concern that the BPD is not requiring its officers to practice appropriate social distancing and face covering in circumstances where to do so is possible. Apparently, the BPD considers compliance with the Governor’s Executive Order inapplicable to them (in fact, one officer told me the Governor’s executive order is unlawful). In fact, the BPD officers I have encountered resort to intentionally abusive behavior when asked to mask. Not exactly models of the kind of behavior that will shore up trust in police officers at this critical juncture in our nation’s faith in law enforcement. Note that I have attached the photos and video referenced in the request. This is a bona fide public health and safety concern. Lives are actually at stake, given the exposure of BPD officers to substantial risk of the virus in recent confrontations. Accordingly, I would appreciate every effort to ensure a timely response, and in fact specifically ask that you provide responses piecemeal as you have them available. I also ask that you and I interact by phone or Zoom in order to address any issues or questions you may have in responding.

This includes any correspondence regarding the “Youth and Police Initiative Plus” program funded by the Department of Homeland Security, as well as any potential expansions of that program within schools and any new applications for funding (e.g. to the Department of Homeland Security’s Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention program). We seek responsive documents within the time period of February 1, 2019 to the date this request is completed. For purposes of this request, “record” means a record in the broadest sense possible, and includes, without limitation, everything tangible, electronic, or digital containing a datum, number, photograph, picture, word, or any other information, including, but not limited to, communications between phones or other electronic devices, e-mails, digital or physical images, video, audio recordings, voicemail messages, social media posts, instructions, directives, guidance documents, formal and informal presentations, training documents, bulletins, notices, alerts, updates, advisories, reports, legal and policy memoranda, contracts, agreements, minutes or notes of meetings and phone calls, and memoranda of understanding. Background This request involves the development and implementation of a federally-funded CVE program in Boston, a matter of longtime and widespread public concern, particularly to Boston’s Muslim and Somali communities. Numerous organizations and communities, including grassroots Muslim-driven organizations, have expressed strong concerns about CVE's deployment in Boston, in particular given the fact that many CVE programs are funded by a federal administration that many perceive as hostile to Muslims, immigrants and Black people. Some have also raised special concerns about a pattern of police outreach programs targeted to Somali communities that have been designed to surveil and profile youth. Moreover, initial public records Muslim Justice League received regarding the YPIP make clear that the individual who had originally agreed to partner in the YPIP and provide access to Somali youth disassociated from the project upon learning more about its apparent intentions and direction via draft surveys related to the project; this fact underscores the public interest in learning how YPIP has since been deployed. These records will contribute to a concerned public’s understanding of YPIP's aims and operations, particularly among Boston's Somali-American young people. MJL devotes a substantial portion of its limited resources to, and has a track record of, educating the public about CVE's deployment, including by posting public records on its website and distributing them at educational forums. Muslim Justice League is a nonprofit §501(c)(3) organization that educates, organizes and advocates for human and civil rights that are violated or threatened under national security pretexts. The requested documents will be made available to the general public and this request is not being made for commercial purposes. In light of the evident public interest and the requestor’s lack of commercial interest, we ask that you waive any fees associated with this request pursuant to M.G.L. c.66, § 10(b)(v). If you decide not to waive fees, we request that you permit us to examine, at our election, the responsive documents before deciding which portions to copy. We would prefer the documents in searchable, electronic format. Should you determine that some portion of the documents requested are exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are no"

We are also requesting any data dictionaries, code tables, or other types of manuals that define, in plain English, the meaning of the column headers in the data, and any codes, acronyms, abbreviations or other shorthand terms used for entries in the data. We are asking for an export of raw data, to the extent maintained in BPD’s databases. We do not expect the City to manually input or alter any information into the data for the purposes of fulfilling this request. Location of the Data: We are not familiar with BPD databases that contain use of force information. Entitlement to Records as Data: The Massachusetts Public Records Act includes public records stored in a computer. We request these records in a machine-readable database or spreadsheet format — such as SQL, CSV, XML, JSON, Excel, or Access files — and not printed out, or converted to PDF files, or otherwise processed in a manner that would decrease the quality, quantity, or accessibility of the original information the records represent. We realize the information may be contained in multiple tables. We are not asking BPD to join tables together for us, or to conduct any type of analysis on the data. We are merely asking for the department to export the raw data, as it exists in the department's database, which should minimize the amount of programming necessary to fulfill our request. We can do the joining on our own, so long as each table contains the unique identifiers and primary keys necessary to join the tables together, and so long as we are provided the necessary documentation to ensure that we are accurately joining and analyzing the data. We are comfortable working with very large databases in many standard data formats. Upon request, we would be happy to provide a USB thumb drive or external hard drive to facilitate the release of these records. Since this information is being sought for journalistic purposes, we request that any fees be waived because disclosure of the responsive records is squarely in the public interest, and will make a significant contribution to the public's understanding of critical issues related to law enforcement.

We want to know how many complaints were exonerated, sustained, unfounded, and any other outcome. 3) An annual breakdown of commissioner-level hearings showing the findings and disposition -- how many cases were heard and how many were sustained, not sustained, exonerated, and any other outcome. In how many cases, if any, did the commissioner divert from the recommended punishment/discipline/outcome? 4) Breakdown of punishment meted out as part of the disciplinary process.

L. c. 66, § 10 (d) (iii); 950 CMR 32.07(2)(m). Black and white paper copies of records shall be provided at a cost of $.05 per page. There is no per page cost for electronic records. I would prefer an electronic response and copies of records. If necessary voluminous electronic records will be made available on a storage device. The cost of the storage device will be no more than the actual cost. The Massachusetts Public Records Act requires a response to this request within ten (10) business days from the business day a written request was received. G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a); 950 CMR 32.06(2)(b). It is possible the City may need additional time to provide any responsive records. The City will provide a “detailed statement” should additional time be necessary to comply with this request. The public records law permits a response time of up to twenty-five (25) business days from the business day a written request is received, so long as a detailed explanation is provided. G. L. c. 66, § 10(b)(vi); 950 CMR 32.06(2)(i). This response applies only to records that exist and are in the custody of the City. It is expected that a custodian of records must use her superior knowledge of her records with respect to responses to public records requests. 950 CMR 32.04(5). If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law."

On June 4, 2020, I sent the following email inquiry to Attorney Shawn Williams. (It did not involve a public records request, but rather I was seeking information.) ""With regard to the City of Boston’s Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) program, on May 1, 2020, Assessing Commissioner Nicholas Ariniello sent invoices to the nonprofits in the program for the second (and final) installment of their cash contributions. The payments were due on June 1, 2020. ""I would like the following information. ""1) The total dollar amount billed to each of the nonprofits this year ""2) The total dollar amount paid by each of the nonprofits this year. 2. On July 1, 2020, Attorney Williams provided me with a spreadsheet containing the information I was seeking (attached). 3. On July 10, 2020, I wrote the following to Attorney Williams. ""Regarding the PILOT program, the second (final) payment was due by June 1, 2020. I have reviewed the PILOT numbers that were provided to me on July 1, 2020. ""In doing so, I have identified two related apparent issues with the numbers, as follows, for which I would very much appreciate an explanation/clarification by next Wednesday, July 15, 2020. “1) A number of organizations that have historically paid all or a large percentage of the cash PILOT amount billed have not done so according to the data provided to me. This could be because they decided to pay substantially less this year, they paid the second half after you provided the data to me, errors in the data, or other reasons. ""The following list is not all inclusive, but rather a sampling of the above agencies. ""Beth Israel Deaconess = 50% ""Brigham and Women’s = 46% ""Dana Farber = 50% ""Mass College of Pharmacy = 46% ""Mass Eye and Ear = 50% ""Mass General = 45% ""New England College of Optometry = 50% ""WGBH = 50% ""2) The following organizations have contributed no cash, which is atypical. ""Boston Medical Center = 0% ""Simmons = 0%” The genesis of my email to Attorney Williams was that I wanted to be certain that my reporting would be accurate. 4. On July 14, 2020, you denied my request for information, stating the following. ""Shawn had shared your below follow up with me and I wanted to provide information from the Assessing Office. On background, we have not had an opportunity to analyze the data as of yet, and once we have completed our program review for the fiscal year, the results will be posted on the City website as they have been in the past.” 5. I never asked for an analysis of the data. 6. In any event, I now make the following public records request. Please provide me with hard copies and electronic copies of any and all records that reflect PILOT payments made subsequent to the data provided to me on July 1, 2020 (#2. above). 7. In the event the information is provided to me in a spreadsheet, I will withdraw this public records request. Thank you. P.S.

If you are not familiar with the IFB, we are a private entity enacted by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1991 to conduct criminal investigations on allegations of insurance fraud incidents that are referred to us by the Insurance Carriers for investigation. Once we refer a case for prosecution, a Boston Police Detective will apply for Criminal Complaints and we accompany them at the Show Cause Hearing and, if necessary, the trial. I am investigating a fraudulent jump-in claim, the result of a collision involving a BPD pursuit which occurred on February 17, 2018, BPD Report # 1182012606. Based upon the information on this case from the insurance carrier, Plymouth Rock Assurance Company, the alleged injured party, Marcus Morisset, was never in the vehicle. BPD Officer Gregory Eunis prepared a very detailed report and the vehicle Morisset alleged he was in at the time of the collision was operated by a Max Toussaint, and Officer Eunis noted only Toussaint was in the vehicle. According to the Plymouth Rock investigation, there was video capture of the collision. I am seeking a copy of the video for my investigation and, as I anticipate referring this case for prosecution, it will be entered into evidence. Once I complete my investigation, I will forward my report and evidence to C-11 Detective Joe Buiel, who, if he determines there is Probable Cause, will then seek Complaints in the Dorchester District Court charging Morisset with: Ch. 266:111B Fraudulent Motor Vehicle Insurance Claim Ch. 277:6 Attempts to Commit Crimes (and Attempted Larceny)."

B001311-082720,2020-08-27,"",BPD Legal Advisor,"Wendy Murphy New England Law Boston August 17, 2020 Boston Police Chief William G. Gross 1 Schroeder Plaza Boston, MA 02120 Dear Chief William G. Gross: We are writing to you on behalf of the Women's and Children's Advocacy Project at New England Law IBoston. We are interested in working with you on the issue of crimes against women, specifically regarding sex/gender-based hate crimes. As you know, sex/gender-based hate crimes are not eligible for prosecution in the Commonwealth because unlike all other protected class categories, sex/gender is not included in G.L. c. 22C, 39. But police departments are required to measure, record, and publish data on sex/gender-based hate crimes, alongside data on all other protected class crimes, under G.L. c. 22C, 32. We are interested in working with you and departments across the Commonwealth to develop criteria for the assessment of sex/gender-based crimes as hate crimes. A ""hate crime"" is defined in 32 as ""any criminal act coupled with overt actions motivated by bigotry and bias including, but not limited to, a threatened, attempted or completed overt act motivated at least in part by racial, religious, ethnic, handicap, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation prejudice, or which otherwise deprives another person of his constitutional rights by threats, intimidation, or coercion, or which seek to interfere with or disrupt a person's exercise of constitutional rights through harassment or intimidation."" Section 33 then states that police departments must establish ""a central repository for the collection and analysis of hate crime data, and, upon the establishment of such repository, the crime reporting unit shall be responsible for collecting, analyzing, classifying and reporting such data."" Section 34 further mandates that collected data and reports be sent to the governor and the state legislature, as well as other relevant authority figures in the Commonwealth. We have examined available data and found that in 2018, only five sex/gender-based hate crimes were recorded by police departments in all of the Commonwealth's cities. Yet 2,410 forcible rapes were reported to police, which reflects a 9% increase from 2017. Given the number of reported rapes, and the fact that over 90% of rapes are committed by men against women, it seems odd that only five sex/gender-based hate crimes were reported for the entire state. Domestic violence crimes are similarly committed disproportionately by men against women; 85% of victims are female, but because domestic violence is not a categorical felony, it is not measured the way other crimes are. Thus, although it is difficult to determine how many domestic violence crimes occur each year, it is apparent they are not being counted as sex/gender-based hate crimes. Even when a man murders a woman after abusing her for many years, the case is not designated as a hate crime. Our project is aimed at improving data collection to make the hate crime nature of violence against women more visible, so that more and better resources can be directed toward prevention, policing, and effective prosecution. To assess the scope of the problem, we are asking all police departments in the Commonwealth to work with us to provide the following information: 1.The number and type of hate crimes recorded by your department for the years 2017-2019; 2.The number of rapes and indecent assault and batteries reported to your department for the years 2017-2019; 3.The number of domestic/family violence, stalking, and 209A violation incidents for the years 2017-2019. It would be helpful if you would also indicate for each category the percentage of victims that were male, female, or other, and the percentage of offenders that were male, female, or other. Our ultimate goal in seeldng this data is to have better measurements of sex/gender-based hate crimes in th"

I told them that I was a licensee of the property owner. They said that no, the property owner called them to complain about me. I asked the who the property owner was or who the complaint was, they said they could not disclose the information. I was spanning three parking spaces, eached owned by different property owners; it was unlikely three owners called this morning. After fifteen minutes, they forced me to leave immediately, leaving all the recyclables there. I requested, and they promised to do but apparently did not do in front of me, that they notified Department of Public Works' Code Enforcement Police (CEP) not to cite property owners what the recyclables they force me to leave behind. Eventually the parting word of one police officer (who rode shotgun) said, ""If you don't leave, that\s [arrest's] what is supposed to happen."" This has been a long-simmering issue for two years. leading to my lawsuit Lu v Capitol Waste Services, Inc, US Dist Ct (D,Mass.) No 19-cv-11458-FDS. Today between 10:30 and 11 am, I placed two phone calls (617-635-4034) to Law Department; not only nobody answered but the voice mail indicated a number which is different from the preceding phone number while asking a caller to leave a message. I am writing the details in a public record request in preparation for more lawsuit against the City, in that there is no law (criminal and civil) against what I have been doing; that I am the licensee whose right the City repeatedly tramples, and that the City colluded with the federal judge to dismiss Lu v Capitol Waste. (2) I request (a) names of Boston police officers with badge numbers 5182 and 5203 (who rode shotgun)); (b) name and telephone number of the property owner(s) who made the complaints (possibly there were more than one this morning, as the two police officers hinted); (c) name(s) or telephone number(s) PLUS dates and time, since July 1, 2018 (yes, more than two years ago) who made the complaints to either CEP, Department of Public Works, Police Department of City of Boston, or 311, about me in the Private Alley 546. )4) Earlier today, I directed the request to Law Department, which just now advised me to address the request to you."

I am requesting the following records in electronic format: 1. All public records requests directed to or related to the Community Ombudsman Oversight Panel or individual staff members of that office between 2005 and the date this request is processed. I am requesting copies of the original requests, not the responsive records to those requests. If you maintain a log of these records in a spreadsheet format, or a similar document, please include that as well. I will pay fees up to $25 for the handling of this request. If the fees will exceed this amount, please inform me before processing my request. Expedited processing I am requesting expedited processing. I believe this request is entitled to such processing because I am a member of the media, employed as a journalist by The New York Times where my role is primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. This request also warrants expedited processing because it seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of government activity around which there is widespread and exceptional media and public interest. These records relate to the relationship between the city and groups related to policing, which has been a topic of widespread and vital public interest in recent months. Fee Waiver I am also requesting a fee waiver. A fee waiver is warranted because the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. I am a full-time journalist and representative of the news media. As such, search and review fees should be waived. If you have any information about this request, please do not hesitate to contact me at mhkeller@nytimes.com or (212) 556-7148. I look forward to your determination. To ensure that this request is properly construed, that searches are conducted in an adequate but efficient manner, and that extraneous costs are not incurred, The New York Times welcomes an opportunity to discuss its request with you before you undertake your search or incur search or duplication costs. By working together at the outset, The New York Times and your agency can decrease the likelihood of costly and time-consuming litigation in the future. Best Regards, Michael Keller"

I cannot find any listing for anywhere. But has been in business since I moved into this building nearly 7 years ago.? I need to find out who the owner is.? I needed a spine surgery after falling. I called the city at 311 numerous times over a seven month. To try and get the rain gutters fixed. Which was the reason why I felt they had holes throughout them they were rusted and rotted through and not my property manager did anything about it, nor did the owner of the Jamaican restaurant which is right where the water landed on the sidewalk causing black ice. Even Boston inspectional services has some responsibility because I showed the video of how bad The leak was with an inspector in April a month after I fell last year. I fell on March 10 and I was in horrendous pain until I had surgery on December 5 of 2020. Now I have fallen a second time at a different address very close to my own home due to walkways or sidewalks being unsafe for people to go on. I want to hold the parties responsible for my falling responsible. First I need the name of the owner of the Jamaican restaurant so I can file at least a small claims against him. It’s not fair that I slipped and fell on black ice on the sidewalk due to two big holes that were dripping and spraying water all day long in a wind canyon making the perfect conditions to create ice. Please get me the information about who owns the Jamaican restaurant on the corner of Coventry Street and Tremont Street. Please and thank you"

BACKGROUND Please include the metadata of intelligence products generated by the fusion center as well as intelligence products received, acquired or transmitted by it from other agencies, including state and federal partners (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, etc.). As part of the intelligence cycle, agencies routinely collect information or data that form the basis of what is commonly called intelligence products. Information is gathered from various sources, which include human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT), etc. The collected intelligence is processed by analysts into a manner suitable for production into finished intelligence products that are then disseminated within an agency or to other agencies. “Intelligence products” includes, but is not limited to, Suspicious Activity Reports, Threat Assessment, Spotlight, Joint Intelligence Bulletins or any other intelligence bulletins, Situational Awareness Reports or any other assessments, briefs, bulletins or reports. Intelligence product metadata may be catalogued as a document log, alerts log and/or product log, and this request includes all of those logs or any manner in which the metadata of the finished intelligence product is catalogued or stored. This request does not include the actual intelligence collected nor the finished intelligence product and is solely related to the title and corresponding metadata of the finished intelligence product as described above. Please preserve all records related to this request that may be subject to deletion. I request that any releases under this request be provided to me in PDF format. FEE CATEGORY AND REQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER As a reporter and DC correspondent for The Nation magazine, I am a representative of the news media. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. Intelligence product catalogues would provide the general public with information about what kinds of intelligence the government is using their tax dollars to generate or access. It would also provide the general public with document titles and codes that they can use to subsequently request any of the documents they may wish to learn more about. I have written extensively about national security matters and will do the same here. My work has been referenced by The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, and other major media outlets. EXEMPTIONS AND SEGREGABILITY If any responsive record or portion thereof is claimed to be exempt or excepted from production, the Massachusetts Public Records Law provides that the agency is to segregate the public information from information that may be withheld and provide the public information to the requester promptly.

I want to know how many hours he was 1) at work being paid regular time, 2) at work being paid OT, 3) paid while he was on leave. Payroll records show Tully earned $40,520.79 in regular pay, $22,202.42 in OT, and $37,519.66 in 'other' pay. I want to confirm that the regular pay and OT was for time he was at work in 2014 and that other pay was for sick or vacation buyback. As always, happy to discuss: 617- 825-0270."

Washington Ave, Unit #1114, Madison, WI Email: kenjklippenstein@gmail.com Phone: (202) 510-1268 RECORDS SOUGHT I respectfully request records sufficient to show the titles of finished intelligence products and all corresponding metadata (e.g. a document number, document type, document date), which may be in the form of a document log, alerts log, and/or product log, of all finished intelligence products produced or possessed by the Massachusetts Commonwealth Fusion Center (CFC) from January 1, 2019, through October 23, 2020. BACKGROUND Please include the metadata of intelligence products generated by the fusion center as well as intelligence products received, acquired or transmitted by it from other agencies, including state and federal partners (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, etc.). As part of the intelligence cycle, agencies routinely collect information or data that form the basis of what is commonly called intelligence products. Information is gathered from various sources, which include human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), measurement and signatures intelligence (MASINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and open source intelligence (OSINT), etc. The collected intelligence is processed by analysts into a manner suitable for production into finished intelligence products that are then disseminated within an agency or to other agencies. “Intelligence products” includes, but is not limited to, Suspicious Activity Reports, Threat Assessment, Spotlight, Joint Intelligence Bulletins or any other intelligence bulletins, Situational Awareness Reports or any other assessments, briefs, bulletins or reports. Intelligence product metadata may be catalogued as a document log, alerts log and/or product log, and this request includes all of those logs or any manner in which the metadata of the finished intelligence product is catalogued or stored. This request does not include the actual intelligence collected nor the finished intelligence product and is solely related to the title and corresponding metadata of the finished intelligence product as described above. Please preserve all records related to this request that may be subject to deletion. I request that any releases under this request be provided to me in PDF format. FEE CATEGORY AND REQUEST FOR A FEE WAIVER As a reporter and DC correspondent for The Nation magazine, I am a representative of the news media. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. Intelligence product catalogues would provide the general public with information about what kinds of intelligence the government is using their tax dollars to generate or access. It would also provide the general public with document titles and codes that they can use to subsequently request any of the documents they may wish to learn more about. I have written extensively about national security matters and will do the same here. My work has been referenced by The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, and other major media outlets. EXEMPTIONS AND SEGREGABILITY If any responsive record or portion thereof is claimed to be exempt or excepted from production, the Massachusetts Public Records Law provides that the agency is to segregate the public information from information that may be withheld and provide the public information to the requester promptly. If documents are denied in part or in whole, please specify which exemption(s) is (are) claimed for"

A response to a public records request must be provided within ten (10) business days from the business day a written request was received. G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a); 950 CMR 32.06(2)(b). It is possible the City may need additional time to provide any responsive records. The City will provide a “detailed statement” to any requester should additional time be necessary to comply with a request. The public records law permits a response time of up to twenty-five (25) business days from the business day a written request is received, so long as a detailed explanation is provided. G. L. c. 66, § 10(b)(vi); 950 CMR 32.06(2)(i). This response applies only to records that exist and are in the custody of the City. See A Guide to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, p. 32, n.115. It is expected that a custodian of records must use her superior knowledge of her records with respect to responses to public records requests. 950 CMR 32.04(5). Specifically, you stated: I'm a reporter with The Boston Globe. We are looking for a list of all 54 homicide victims in the city this year. We have the IDs for 47 of the 54 victims. If it's helpful, I can send over the names of the victims that have been ID'd in the paper. Feel free to let me know. I'm at 857-559-3234. Thanks for the time and consideration. A municipal records custodian is permitted to assess fees for the provision of public records. G. L. c. 66, § 10 (d); 950 CMR 32.07. A municipality may assess an hourly rate of up to $25.00 per hour to search for records responsive to public records requests, but may not charge for the first two hours of work. G. L. c. 66, § 10 (d) (iii); 950 CMR 32.07(2)(m). Black and white paper copies of records shall be provided at a cost of $.05 per page. It is presumed that a requester prefers electronic copies of records when available. There is no per page cost for electronic records. If necessary voluminous electronic records will be made available on a storage device. The cost of the storage device will be no more than the actual cost. Government records custodians are permitted to redact or withhold portions of public records, so long as a specific exemption to the law is cited. See G. L. c. 4, § 7 (26). Portions of records responsive to your request may contain information that is exempt from disclosure. You may appeal this response to the Supervisor of Records in the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 66, § 10A (c); G. L. c. 66, § 10(b)(ix); 950 CMR 32.08; 950 CMR 32.08(1)(h) (in petitioning the Supervisor, the requester shall provide a copy of such petition to the records access officer associated with such petition). You may also appeal to the Superior Court. 950 CMR 32.06(3)(c). Thank you, Sgt. Det. John Boyle"

Here’s that email I mentioned seeking internal affairs information about police officer Rance Cooley. Please consider this a request for information. I am looking for the disposition of the following five internal affairs cases, and the sanctions/discipline that was issued for each, if there were any. I’m also looking for confirmation that there are no other internal affairs cases for Officer Cooley over the last 10 years. 2009-0057 (date received 7-25-2009, date occurred 12/14/2008) 2009-0051 (date received 8/6/2009, date occurred 10/28/2008) 2009-0060 (date received 11/4/2009, date occurred unknown) 2009-0061 (date received 11/4/2009, date occurred 10/6/2005) 2009-0062 (date received 11/4/2009, date occurred 10/2/2003) As I mentioned, I have questions/confusion related to the dates received and occurred for some of these cases, which is why this request will be helpful. (some of the date received, for instance, are years after the incidents allegedly occurred, and I am looking for explanation of why) Separately, I have an arbitration award (see the text listed below) related to case 2009-0051, and I believe that is related to Officer Cooley’s testimony in federal court in October 2008, though I was looking for confirmation on that. “On February 19, 2013, Police Commissioner Edward F. Bavis executed a Settlement Agreement with Police Officer Rance Cooley, ID# 74878, assigned to the Bureau of Field Services/District A-1, Org.# 41010 for a violation_ of Rule 102 §4 (Neglect of Duty-(2 counts) and §23 (Department Reports-Inaccurate Reporting) of the Boston Police Department Rules and Procedures arising out ofiAD Case No. 12009-051. Officer Cooley failed to accurately document a portion of an incident that involved another officer in an incident report, failed to adequately review an affidavit prior to signing the document, and failed to properly prepare himself for court testimony. ) In resolution of this matter, Officer Cooley has accepted a five (5) working day suspension with three (3) working days to serve and the balance to remain in abeyance for one (1) year from the date of execution of the Agreement. Officer Cooley will begin the suspension on February 21, 2013.” I also am aware of allegations that were made by an attorney in a state criminal court case in 2010, and which reference an incident in 2005 as well as raised questions about Officer Cooley’s testimony in that case, during a trial in 2008. However, I cannot tell which of the above listed cases refer to the described allegation in court records. I am expecting these records will shed light on that confusion. Here’s a link to that story. http://archive.boston. com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/09/boston_police_officer_accused_of_misleading_court_in_09_ case/ If I can do anything to better facilitate or explain this request, kindly advise.
