I request this information from Jan. 1, 2019 to present. We request this information in electronic format. If any fields or records are deleted or redacted, please provide a detailed explanation of the exemption under the laws your office relies on to justify the deletion or redaction. Also please provide all documentation necessary to load and analyze this data, including the record layout for each table, field descriptions and electronic copies of the codes. As you are aware, the state Public Records Law does not allow a blanket exemption for public records but instead requires the custodian of the records to justify withholding any or all parts of a record by the application of narrowly- defined exemptions. When exempt information is intertwined with non-exempt information, the non-exempt portions are subject to disclosure once the exempt portions are deleted. If any or all or any part of this request is denied, please cite the specific statutory exemption(s) which you believe justifies your refusal to release the information and inform me of your agency&#39;s administrative appeals procedures available to BU under the statute(s). The law requires your agency provide a response to this request within 10 days by either denying the request or making an offer to provide the requested materials. I request an expedited response to this request and a waiver of all fees, as allowed for by the state statute.

Ms. Vieira has admitted to making calls during the month of February to certain BPS students who did not apply to the exam schools by the stated deadline, to let them know that they could still apply. These calls were selective in nature -- not all Boston Public School students who met the eligibility requirements for the exam schools but did not apply received a phone call or any other notification of the deadline ""extension."" The original January deadline remained posted on the BPS website. It is therefore imperative that the public have access to internal emails between Ms. Vieira and staff regarding the reasons for these calls, and records of who was called, in order to determine whether these calls were discriminatory in nature (i.e., Ms. Vieira was attempting to engineer the applicant pool to achieve desired demographical results). Ms. Vieira may have made some of these phone calls on her personal telephone, and therefore those records should be deemed part of this request."

Specifically, I request the following fields: -Date/Time occurred -type of charge -criminal charge files -subject name - subject sex -subject race -subject age -subject date of birth - subject address - level of resistance (and the subfeilds) - subject armed with (and the subfeilds) - witness race - witness sex - officer rank - officer sex - officer age - officer duty status - officer level - address of incident - officer employee id - officer badge - resist arrest - weapons/physical force (and the subfeilds) We are also requesting any data dictionaries, code tables, or other types of manuals that define, in plain English, the meaning of the column headers in the data, and any codes, acronyms, abbreviations or other shorthand terms used for entries in the data. We are asking for an export of raw data, to the extent maintained in the departments databases. We do not expect the department to manually input or alter any information into the data for the purposes of fulfilling this request. Redactions: If a record contains both exempt and non-exempt information, the non-exempt information should still be provided: Because we are requesting data, each distinct type of information is separated into its own field (i.e. column), making it easy to redact exempt information en masse. Entitlement to Records as Data: We request these records in a machine-readable database or spreadsheet format — such as SQL, CSV, XML, JSON, Excel, or Access files — and not printed out, or converted to PDF files, or otherwise processed in a manner that would decrease the quality, quantity, or accessibility of the original information the records represent. We realize the information may be contained in multiple tables. We are not asking the department to join tables together for us, or to conduct any type of analysis on the data. We are merely asking for the department to export the raw data, as it exists in the department's inPursuit database, which should minimize the amount of programming necessary to fulfill our request. Additionally we are in possession of the inPursuit records management manual. As such, we are acutly aware of how and what data is stored by the Boston PD. All fields requested are part of this system, if the custodian has any trouble finding the record we are happy to assist by citing the section of the manual which outlines the procedure for data exportation. We can do the joining on our own, so long as each table contains the unique identifiers and primary keys necessary to join the tables together, and so long as we are provided the necessary documentation to ensure that we are accurately joining and analyzing the data. We are comfortable working with very large databases in many standard data formats. Upon request, we would be happy to provide a USB thumb drive or external hard drive to facilitate the release of these records. Other Provisions: If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $50. However, since this information is being sought for public research purposes, we request that any fees be waived because disclosure of the responsive records is squarely in the public interest and will make a significant contribution to the public's understanding of critical issues related to policing.

We are in the process of completing a national study on hate crime investigations, funded by the National Institute of Justice. We are obtaining the number of investigations law enforcement agencies investigated from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, where there was an indicator of possible hate or bias motivation by an offender against an individual's or a group's race, religion, ethnic/national origin, gender, age, disability, or sexual orientation. According to the Massachusetts Crime database, the Boston Police conducted over 140 hate crime investigations in 2018. Would you be able to confirm that this number is accurate? Also, we have been following up with the officers who investigated these cases to gather additional information regarding the type of bias, the crime committed, whether there was an arrest, and de-identifying information about the victim and suspect. We understand, however, that this would be overly burdensome to agencies with a large number of cases, so for those agencies we are requesting redacted police reports to gather this information. Given the amount of cases your agency had in 2018, we would take a random sample of about 25 cases. Would it be possible to get a list of all the incident numbers so we can get a random sample and then request police reports for those cases? Thank you for your help with the study, Leanne Gast"
