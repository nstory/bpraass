The landlord is listed as 64 Chelsea Street, LLC and is owned by Daniel Samandarov. Before being constructively evicted from his apartment, Mr. Briody had contacted the City of Boston Inspectional Services to inspect the building. The investigator found numerous violations on September 2, 2021, and found that none of them had been remedied upon re-inspection on October 7, 2021. I attached those two reports for reference here, although they admittedly aren’t of the best quality. As an initial matter I was hoping you could forward me cleaner copies of the same. Additionally, I was hoping that you would be so kind as to forward me any additional reports, correspondence, pictures or any other documents that you have regarding the condition of the building, my client’s Unit, and/or against the Defendant 64 Chelsea Street, LLC or Daniel Samandarov. You can see the second report says ""prosecution recommended"" and my client also thought that a hearing may have been scheduled between the City of Boston and the landlord over the alleged violations, so if you have any documents regarding the prosecution/hearing, or could let me know if there is an upcoming hearing date, I would greatly appreciate it.

She also stated that she had email notification lists to alert people to projects and meetings. - The Finance Commission is requesting a list of project; - the email notification lists for each project; -any hard or electronic correspondences supporting or against the projects; -and the hard copy or electronic sign-in sheets for each public meeting that was held regarding each bike lane project. We are requesting documents from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2022. 2. The Finance Commission has had a number of email correspondences with Chief of Streets, Jascha Franklin-Hodge. In one of those communications Mr. Franklin-Hodge indicated that it is a regular course of business to conduct informal and formal observations of both temporary and permanent bike lanes throughout the City of Boston.

The Finance Commission is requesting all documents, work-product, reports, notes, interviews, meeting minutes, emails, correspondences, whether hard copy or electronic communications, relative to all formal and informal observations and evaluations of bike lane installations. We are requesting documents from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2022.

We as final semester students are asked to complete a capstone project in a desired area of study. Given that I am a student within the Justice Administration concentration, I thought my research topic should focus on the 2020 Massachusetts Police Reform Bill as it pertains to newly adopted use of force measures. Currently, I seek to examine the effectiveness of the freshly enacted 2020 Police Reform bill. Specifically, as a researcher I am trying to analyze use of force data across the state of Massachusetts. I am trying to determine and contribute to the conclusion of if this bill is working in the manner that in which it was intended to. To complete and come to a conclusive answer to this research question, I would need data to represent use of force incidences from the Boston Police Department. We have chosen Boston Police as one of our jurisdictions due to city population to officer ratio. If possible, is there a method to provide access to this information for the purposes of this project? The data would simply be a running total or count of use of force reports preadoption of the 2020 police reform and after enactment of the 2020 police reform, and type of force reported in these occurrences. Respectfully Submitted, Peirce A. Peace"

Chapter 66, Section 10). I am requesting that I be provided with a copy of the following records, which I would ask be sent in electronic form (such as a PDF or Word or Excel file), if possible: • Officer Matthew Morrissey's personal file We recognize that you may charge reasonable costs for copies, as well as for personnel time needed to comply with this request. Please notify us of the estimated costs before you start compiling the requested records. The Public Records Law requires you to provide me with a written response within 10 business days. If you cannot comply with my request, you are statutorily required to provide an explanation in writing. We have been told that we cannot have access to the records we are seeking because of an “open and ongoing investigation” but I do not believe that the records I am seeking are exempt. Exemption (f) to the Public Records Law does not create a blanket exemption. Rather, the burden rests on the Department to show as to each requested record that (i) the information contained “would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure would not be in the public interest,” G.L. c. 4, § 7(26)(f), and (ii) the entire record must be withheld, rather than redacting the information that poses a “grave risk” of disclosing information contrary to the public interest. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Police Comm’r, 419 Mass. 853, 858 (1995) (“the existence of some exempt information in a document will not justify cloture as to all of it because the right to access extends to any nonexempt segregable portion of a public record”) (citations omitted)."

Rick and Adrienne were at dinner at Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ located at 1002 Beacon St. in Brookline between the hours of approximately 4pm to 6pm on Monday evening, 2/28/22. During their meal, their car was parked on Beacon Street between Park Drive & St. Mary’s Street going westbound. Following the meal, they returned to their car and noticed significant damage to the front left bumper, which appears to have been a hit & run scenario that occurred during the meal. No note was left by whoever hit the car, no contact information - nothing at all, so we currently have no way of getting licence plate information to make a claim with our insurance company nor file a report with the police. I have attached photos of the damage, so you can see just how extensive it is. With all of this information, is it possible to get the camera footage of Beacon Street between Park Drive and St. Mary's Street between 4pm & 6pm from 2/28/22? It would be incredibly helpful for insurance purposes if we are able to track down whoever hit the car, so please let me know when you can.

Shea and I am a Deputy Chief on the Boston Fire Department and the Fire Marshal for the City of Boston. I am requesting a copy of a complaint submitted by a realtor on the Boston 311 app back in July or early August (before 8/18) of 2021. The woman complained that a member of the department doing a smoke detector inspection (of a property she was selling) had talked to her inappropriately. I have misplaced this complaint and need it to complete a file folder on my investigation of this matter. Thank you in advance.
