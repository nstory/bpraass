On Tuesday March 30, 1999 police responded to 84 Spencer Street, Dorchester discovering two dead bodies. The bodies were discovered inside the second floor apartment of the Spencer St. address by the landlord. Responding officers entered the apartment and observed one male and one female victim. While inside the apartment officers heard a faint cry of a small child. Officers then discovered an approximately six month old baby inside a crib. The child had been covered by an overturned drawer and clothing and was experiencing some respiratory distress. The infant was removed from the apartment and trasnported to the hospital for treatment. The female victim was identified as 22 year old Shakonda Wilson who lived at the Spencer St. address with her infant daughter. The male victim was 21 year old William ""BJ"" Haynesworth Jr. Shakonda died as a result of being strangled and William died as a result of head and neck trauma, both victims of homicide."

This information will be aggregated and deidentified. It will be used to understand if there are geographic patterns or housing type patterns (such as single-family homes, apartments, etc.) to the reporting of suspected hoarding cases. I would need the address of the property being reported (not just the zip code, since zip codes can span multiple neighborhoods). However, individual addresses would not be used in any research products, but aggregated as simply ""one of 10, "" for example, reports in a particular neighborhood. I would also need to know how the case was managed by the city (e.g., ""referred to ISD"") to understand the trajectories of suspected hoarding cases. Record request change: Rather than receiving all 311 data requested for the years 2010-2019, I really only need to see the entries related to suspected hoarding. This may be achieved by doing keyword searches of the open textbox.

Can you please send me the police report for that incident today and anything else that can be released? The federal case involves straw purchases of Glocks for Rodriguez that were made at the Littleton Mill, which I reported on as the largest cluster of federally licensed firearms manufacturers in the nation, known in local gun circles as a place where some of the dealers are willing to exploit loopholes in state gun restrictions. In this case, two dealers worked together to sell the straw purchaser and Rodriguez the parts of the Glock. Also, would it be possible to speak to the commissioner, at least briefly, on the importance of closely monitoring gun dealers, and how often crime guns in Boston are linked to gun dealers in Massachusetts? It’s interesting that these federal charges were actually broken by BPD — not the ATF. Thanks! Sarah Ryley Boston Globe, Reporter Cell:"

(“ACLUM”). This request follows years of advocacy by ACLUM concerning the content and transparency of the Boston Police Department’s Field Interrogation/Observation/Encounter Records generated under BPD Rule 323 (generally called “FIO Reports” or “FIOE Reports”). Among other things, ACLUM has raised concerns about evidence of racially disparate treatment reflected in these reports, and ACLUM has urged that data concerning these reports be regularly published and made available to the public. The BPD has made FIO records publicly available and searchable beginning with the year 2011. ACLUM renews its request that BPD make regular and contemporaneous disclosures on Analyze Boston1 of FIO records. Please note that, in recent years, the records disclosures made on Analyze Boston have omitted some previously available FIO data fields, including (but not limited to) stop reasons, fiofs type/reasons, and whether and what type of search was conducted. ACLUM requests that all available data concerning field stops be published. ACLUM hereby requests the following: 1. All reports for FIOs conducted between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, including but not limited to the following data: a. the location, district, date, and time of the FIO; b. the age, gender, race, ethnicity, complexion, clothing, and address of the subject, and whether the subject was reported as having a prior record; c. the FIOFS type, and whether terrorism was involved; d. the contact reason, basis, and circumstance; e. the motor vehicle state, make, year, color and model/body, and whether the subject was the occupant or driver of the motor vehicle; f. the type of search conducted and the basis for the search; the reason for the stop and “FIOFS” reason (including any narrative explanations); g. the outcome of the encounter and the stop duration; h. any comments noted on the FIO form; i. the officer and supervisor names and IDs, and the officer’s district; and j. the date and time the FIO was filled out, entered into the database, or revised, along with the corresponding user names. Consistent with past records productions, I ask that you waive any fees and copying costs, pursuant to 950 C.M.R. 32.07. ACLUM is a not-for-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality, and this request is made in the public interest. We expressly exclude from the requested records any individually identifiable information of non-BPD personnel. However, if you withhold or redact some portions of the requested documents on the grounds that they are exempt from disclosure, please specify which exemptions apply and release any portions of the records for which you do not claim an exemption. We ask that you provide the records in electronic format to the maximum extent possible and disclose the data on Analyze Boston and continue to do so regularly and contemporaneously. As you know, a custodian of public records shall comply with a request within ten days of receipt. Thank you for your assistance.

Our city police force is going through negotiations regarding police bodycameras, and I had a few questions about Boston PD's use of bodycameras and policy surrounding them. First - does Boston PD use bodycams? If so - what are the policies around officers reviewing their bodycam footage before writing their reports? Do those policies differ depending on the incident? For example, can officers review footage for non-force-related incidents before writing a report? How about incidents involving lethal or non-lethal force? Our city and local police union are at odds over bodycam policy and I was hoping to compare similar sized city police departments for their own policies regarding when footage can be reviewed when it comes to writing reports.

Under the Criminal Justice Reform Act, school districts and law enforcement agencies must “specify the manner and division of responsibility for collecting and reporting the school-based arrests, citations and court referrals of students to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education” (DESE). DESE began collecting data on school-related arrests in the 2018-19 school year. In the 2019-20 school year, DESE has expanded that collection to include data on all referrals to law enforcement. DESE has defined these terms as follows, borrowing the same definitions used by the U.S. Department of Education since its 2009 Civil Rights Data Collection. A school-related arrest “[r]efers to an arrest of a student for any activity conducted on school grounds, during off campus school activities (including while taking school transportation), or due to a referral by any school official. All school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.” A referral to law enforcement “[i]s an action by which a student is reported to any law enforcement agency or official, including a school police unit, for an incident that occurs on school grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school transportation, regardless of whether official action is taken. Citations, tickets, court referrals, and school-related arrests are considered referrals to law enforcement.” I request the following public records, as defined in G. L. c. 4, § 7 (twenty-sixth): 1. An extract of your records management system or database that includes each school-related arrest and each referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). Specifically, we request an extract of the database to include the following columns: a. Date of arrest or referral to law enforcement b. Time of arrest or referral to law enforcement c. Charge (or charges) d. Whether the individual(s) was arrested or referred to law enforcement e. Sex of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement f. Age of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement g. Race of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement h. Ethnicity of individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement i. Disability status of the individual(s) arrested or referred to law enforcement j. Whether the individual arrested or referred to law enforcement is a student at the school. k. Name of arresting officer, if applicable, and l. Badge number of the arresting officer or the officer that referred the youth to law enforcement, as applicable. 2. If such an extract of the database in question 1 is not possible, please provide school incident reports on each school-related arrest and referral to law enforcement conducted during the 2018-2019, 2019- 2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 school year (up until the day the records are produced). 3.

The other were three different assault and battery charges and a strangulation charge. This happened at his family’s house on 56 Presentation Road in Brighton for about a month.

Wanted to ask: (1) if the police report has been updated at all since Feb. 19, or if any addendums have been added? (2) what is the status of both officers involved in the crash (injured leave, etc.)? (3) if the department is also investigating the incident, or has any comment? Also wanted to request any body camera footage of the incident, as the police report indicates officers had their body-worn cameras at the time.

In November and December, the Suffolk DA’s office assented to Mr. Kamara’s motion for a new trial and agreed to nolle prosequi the indictments if a judge signs off. A judge may take action on the case today. New court filings by both the prosecution and the defense agree that evidence was wrongly withheld at Mr. Kamara’s trial that pointed to another potential killer. Det Flynn and ADA Larkin both had this information, according to the filings. According to defense filings, Larkin and Flynn were implicated in misconduct that caused the wrongful conviction of another man, Robert Foxworth, in a murder that occurred exactly one week after the murder in Kamara's case. Foxworth served 28 years before his conviction was overturned. Here are my questions. My deadline is 4 p.m. today. 1) I’ve been told that Sgt Det Flynn is deceased. Can you confirm whether that is accurate? 2) How many other people were convicted in homicide cases handled by Sgt Det Flynn? Can we get a list of his cases? 3) Homicide summary sheets previously provided by BPD show in 1990 a Sgt Flynn (no first name given) handled five homicide cases. (Victims Jose Pepin, Rowan S Lewis, James Merchent, Archange Bruno, Wesley Campbell). Records show Sgt Det Flynn handled another 5 cases in 1992. Is this the same Sgt Det Flynn? 4) Can I get the assignment details for Sgt Det Flynn during his career, including the dates he was assigned to homicide? 5) Is BPD taking a broader look at other homicide cases handled by Sgt Det Flynn to look for other evidence of misconduct? Why or why not? 6) Does BPD have a policy when misconduct comes to light in an old conviction? Does it trigger an automatic review of other cases handled by that detective or officer? Or is there no policy? 7) Does BPD have any comment on Mr. Kamara’s case? Thanks, Andrew Andrew Ryan Reporter andrew.ryan@globe.com @GlobeAndrewRyan"

In late May or June of 1973, an apartment my family was residing in on Brimmer St. was unlawfully entered by an intruder through a fire escape window. My father was held at knifepoint and my mom had to find things of value in the home to give to the intruder/thief. They struck a deal with him in which he would leave peacefully through the front door of the building, and my mom would escort him down the stairs. Before leading him down the stairs she grabbed a whistle. This came in handy as the intruder tried to change the deal at the front door and attempted to take my mother with him. She blew hard on the whistle, he hit her on the head with the knife, but thankfully ran away. The perpetrator was never apprehended. I was a baby when this event happened and my older sister kept me quiet in our bedroom while all of this was going on. For personal reasons I am doing a bit of research and would like to have access to the incident report."
