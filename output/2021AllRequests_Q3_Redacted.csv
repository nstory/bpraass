B001151-070121,2021-07-01,2021-09-08,OPC,"Diana Stroud The Law Office of Michelle Menken I am seeking any and all materials, including but not limited to, police reports, supplemental reports, notes, and memoranda of interviews, dated March 13, 1996 onward, relating to CC # 60-131443, an investigation into the homicide of Walter Poe. I submitted a similar public record request to the Boston Police Department (Department) on 3/24/2021. In response to my prior request, I was told to contact the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office (SCDAO) instead. The Department asserted that, because SCDAO directs and controls homicide investigations, the SCDAO had sole “control” of all documents response to my request. The Department concluded that, as a result, it had “no authorization to release copies of homicide records.” The Department closed the request on 3/26/2021. For the reasons stated below, I believe that the Department is both authorized and required to disclose documents responsive to the request I am submitting on the present date. The public records law is intended to provide “the public [with] broad access to governmental records.” Worcester Tel. & Gazette Corp. v. Chief of Police of Worcester, 436 Mass. 378, 382-383 (2002). Accordingly, the law applies to all “documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee” of a government entity. G. L. c. 4, § 7, Twenty-sixth. Any such materials that are “within the possession, custody or control” of the entity must be provided for inspection upon request. G. L. c. 66, § 10 (a) (ii). By its plain language, the statute mandates that an agency have either possession, or custody, or control of the requested documents, not all three. Further, as the Supreme Judicial Court has explicitly held, an agency is required to disclose public records it has created or received, even if another agency is designated as the owner of the record. See Rahim v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 486 Mass. 544, 548 (2020) (holding that FBI materials provided to State agency as part of terrorism investigation were subject to public records law, regardless of fact that FBI claimed that it was the exclusive owner of the materials). If the Department has possession or custody of responsive documents, those documents are subject to disclosure, regardless whether the Department asserts that the SCDAO controls those documents. See id. (“If every public records request also required the requestor to conduct something akin to a title search, then the public would necessarily be stymied in its quest for greater government transparency.”). Cf. Harvard Crimson, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College, 445 Mass. 745, 755 (2006) (reports created by private university would qualify as public records “[o]nce in the custody of the department of State police”). Indeed, prior cases indicate that individuals have sought, and been provided, homicide investigation documents from the investigating police department. See, e.g., Commonwealth vs. Haley, Mass. Super. Ct., No. 1971CR58947 (Suffolk County Aug. 26, 2008) (indicating that individual requested, and received, homicide investigation records from BPD); see also Mullen vs. Silva, Mass. Super. Ct., No. 0073CV00413, (Bristol County Dec. 10, 2001). Please contact me if you have any questions about this request, and thank you in advance for your assistance. [SPR21/2073] CiovO\"

R001373-072021,2021-07-19,2021-08-12,Public Records,"Colman Herman Freelance Reporter In a surprise move, federal district court Judge William Young withdrew his opinion Friday in a Boston exam school admission case, because he said he believed the school system’s attorney misled him by excluding racially charged text messages from the court record. . . . Young ordered the attorneys to file a detailed brief in 30 days explaining why the text messages were never submitted to the court and why no one from the city’s legal department notified the court about the text messages after they recently were leaked to the media. . . . In waging their defense, city attorneys have stressed in a motion they filed earlier this week and in the Friday hearing that they never vouched that a transcript of text messages submitted to the court was a complete accounting of all such communications between School Committee members during the night the temporary plan was approved. They only attested the information in the transcript was accurate. On July 18, 2021,The Boston Globe reported the following. The sequence of events leading to the judge’s ruling started well before Janey stepped into the mayor’s office. Last year, after the School Committee voted to change the admissions process at Boston Latin and the other exam schools, the Globe and others filed public records requests for communications that school committee members exchanged during the contentious meeting. The city provided what later proved to be an incomplete and legally deficient response, withholding ill-advised text messages between two members expressing animus toward white families in West Roxbury who had opposed the changes, which yielded greater racial diversity at the schools. That clumsy coverup was bad enough when it served to mislead the public. But the city compounded its problem by asserting in March that those same exchanges were “true and accurate.” After the withheld text messages surfaced this spring, the city’s lawyer lamely insisted that true and accurate wasn’t the same as “complete.” The judge, William Young, was having none of it. “I thought I had the complete messages and telling me now that it wasn’t stipulated that it was complete falls on extremely deaf ears,” he said. Regarding the above matter, please provide me with copies of any and all communications in which Shawn Williams was a sender or recipient. Communications include, but are not limited to, emails, text messages, letters, memoranda, faxes, and/or notes. If any communications were carried out on personal devices, they are responsive public records and therefore must be produced.

Additionally, we spoke briefly about if the department employs a statistician or data scientist, and if anyone has run any statistical analyses to determine if the changes in crime rate over time are statistically significant (note that statistical significance is different from an individual's assessment of whether a drop in crime is emotionally significant to someone- Statistical significance helps quantify whether a result is likely due to chance or to some factor of interest where emotional significance may be something that is noteworthy or of importance).

In order to assist you with your review, I have attached a 2 page DPH internal memo dated March 3, 2007. The author describes being contacted by Lt. Det. Frank Mancini regarding various cases of suspected evidence tampering. The matter was apparently referred to Charles Salemi, the Hinton Drug Lab supervisor, so that DPH could follow up with the BPD detectives. It is my understanding that in January of 2008, BPD released a 164 page internal audit discussing the findings of the investigation. Due to the fact that the investigation has already closed, these records are not exempt from disclosure due to an ongoing investigation."

During this time I was in a local restaurant having dinner (Saltie Girl, on Newbury St and Dartmouth St). When I returned to my car after dinner I drove away from the parking spot, and after about two blocks I noticed that the rear window of my car had shattered. After pulling over to assess the damage, I noticed that there was no evidence of any blunt object, like a tree branch, sign, or anything else, that had collided with the window causing it to shatter. As such, I drove the car home to my apartment garage. I would like to see any video footage from cameras in the area that might have captured the window shattering, so we can identify the cause. This will be very helpful in my pursuing a claim for reimbursement of the repair of the damage with my insurance company and/or with Tesla motors.

I am wondering if you might explain to me why you are refusing to speak with me. Mr. Musselman did not respond to my inquiry. 2) On August 3, 2021, I wrote the following to Mr. Musselman. Have you notified residents that Eversource changed its supplier rate as of July 1, 2021? 3) On August 5, 2021, I wrote the following to Stacia Sheputa. May I please get a response to my question below? [#2 above] 4) On August 5, 2021, Ms. Sheputa responded to me as follows. The City updated the Boston Community Choice website with the new rates and we are planning on sending a mailing within the next couple of weeks to update enrolled customers on the City's rate change in November. 5) On August 5, 2021, I responded to Ms. Sheputa as follows. — When did you update the website? — Please point me to where the new Eversource rates are on the website. 6) On August 5, 2021, Ms. Sheputa responded to me as follows. The website was updated on 7/1/21. Under ""rates"" you will see the following which takes you to the Eversource rates. 7) On August 5, 2021, I responded to Ms. Sheputa as follows. 1) Why is it taking so long to send out notice that Eversource has the lower rate? People could have switched to the new rate as of July 1 and saved money all this time. 2) Does Mr. Musselman think the new Eversource rate is easy to find on the city website? 3) One of those records I obtained was an email from Mark Cappadona [consultant] to Mr. Musselman in which he states the following. The Eversource Rates for the Summer Rates have been dropped. They are high, not as high as I would have liked. Why would Mr. Cappadona want the Eversource rates to be higher? Ms. Sheputa did not respond to my inquiry. 8) On August 4, 2021, I wrote the following to Mr. Cappadona. Using the public records law, I have accessed some records from the City of Boston. One of those records was an email from you to David Musselman in which you state the following. “The Eversource Rates for the Summer Rates have been dropped. They are high, not as high as I would have liked.” Why would you want the Eversource rates to be higher? Mr. Cappadona did not respond to my inquiry. 9) Please provide me with copies of any and all communications related to the above interactions. Communications include, but are not limited to, emails, text messages, letters, memoranda, faxes, and/or notes. If any related communications were carried out via personal devices, they are public records and therefore must be produced. 10) In responding to my public records request, please be aware of the following. a) A denial must detail the specific basis for withholding the requested information. The denial must include a citation to one of the statutory or common-law exemptions upon which you rely and must explain why the exemption applies. b) Where exempt information is intertwined with non-exempt information, the non-exempt portions are subject to disclosure once the exempt portions are deleted. . c) You have ten business days to respond. 11) Please note that I am submitting this public records request in my capacity as a freelance reporter with no affiliation with any particular media outlet."

I am a 52-year-old that is currently in the process of retiring from the Local 7 Boston Union Ironworkers Local where I have 30 years’ service and for the past 18 years was a general foreman over seeing over 300 union members on a daily basis on multiple jobs. I moved to CT and I am trying to get CT driver’s license but I am being told that I have unpaid parking tickets in Boston. After looking at the dates of said tickets I have found that all tickets were issued in error by the city during the construction of the Room and Board building located at 375 Newbury Street in Boston. During this project the General Contractor had permitted multiple parking spaces for this project with the city yet still had multiple issues with the parking tickets issued. At one point we had a supervisor called to the location to review all the issues and was told that all parking tickets would be waived, and the issues stopped. Yet it appears years later these tickets are still not correctly addressed and now is affecting my ability to be able to get my drivers license in the state of CT. I would like to ask that your office investigate these matters and over see that the tickets be waived as they were to be years ago. In the event that the City does not wish to simply correct this matter as it stated in the past by waiving the tickets it would do then I would like to formally request under the State Freedom of information Act the following items; 1) All parking permits issued to general contractors for years 2013 and 2014 2) All parking tickets already waived at the or around the construction site of 375 Newbury Street, Boston from Sept 2013 to April 2014. 3) All parking officers and supervisors assigned to the area and street of Newbury Street, Boston from Sept 2013 to April 2014. 4) The minutes of the meeting and or the report filed by the Supervisor whom came to the job site located at 375 Newbury Street, Boston to resolve all these parking ticket issues for the general contractor that had paid the city to permit the spaces for this construction site. Its my hopes that I will not need to file a action with the courts to seek to resolve these matters that was already to have been resolved and I hope that your office can help to resolve them. Please note I have worked in the City of Boston for a great number of years and have never ever gotten a parking ticket on any other project. These tickets were a case of misunderstanding between the parking ticket officer, the city permits issued and etc. and were all to have been corrected years ago. The tickets in question are as follows: 675209301, 675686922, 674483493, 674496642, 675892943, 675819675, 675820003, 674066956. CiovO\"

Request for Public Documents Pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records Law, Open The Government makes the following request for records. The murder of George Floyd in May 2020 sparked renewed interest in America’s police departments and law enforcement agencies, and their respective policies, including policies around releasing information. Public information officers (PIOs) often serve as a conduit for information to reach the media and the public, and these PIOs continue to play an active role in determining and controlling which information is released. During the protests following Floyd’s murder, and numerous other notable instances of policing activity, members of the media sought information from the Boston Police Department to inform their coverage of current events. Open The government requests documents to shed light on the policies that Boston Police Department’s public information officers follow when determining which media requests to answer and which information to release. Requested Records Open The Government requests that the Boston Police Department produce the following records within ten business days: A complete copy (including any attachments) of any formal or informal guidance, directives, memoranda, or other policy and procedure documents or records utilized by employees of the Boston Police Department who are not public information officers when processing a media request. You can omit any formal or informal guidance, directives, memoranda, or other policy and procedure documents or records utilized exclusively by the Boston Police Department’s public information officers (PIOs) when responding to media requests; we are only interested in records utilized by non-PIOs. Please provide all responsive records from May 1, 2020 to the day the search is conducted. Fee Waiver Request Open The Government requests that your agency consider waiving any fees associated with processing this request for records. The general public has a significant interest in how the Boston Police Department determines which information is made available to the media, and subsequently the public. Records with the potential to shed light on this process would contribute significantly to public understanding of operations of the Boston Police Department. Open The Government is a nonpartisan 501(c)(3) that works to strengthen our democracy and empower the public by advancing policies that create a more open, accountable, and responsive government. Open The Government uses the information gathered, and its analysis of it, to educate the public through reports, press releases, or other media. Open The Government also makes materials it gathers available on its public website and promotes their availability on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. To the extent your agency anticipates charging any feels with this request for records, Open The Government requests that you inform us in advance of doing so. Guidance Regarding the Search & Processing of Requested Records In connection with this request for records, Open The Government provides the following guidance regarding the scope of the records sought, the search of records, and the processing of records. • Please search all locations and systems likely to have responsive records, regardless of format, medium or physical characteristics • In conducting your search, please understand that the term “record” or “document” in its broadest sense, to include any written, typed, recorded, graphic, printed or audio material of any kind. We seek records of any kind, including electronic records, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs, as well as letters, emails, facsimiles, telephone messages, voice mail messages and transcripts, notes, or minutes of any meetings, telephone conversations or discussions"
