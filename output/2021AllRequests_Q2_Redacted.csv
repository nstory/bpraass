On those two days there was a man wearing a green baseball cap dressed in mostly black. He was wearing a black coat that had some gray arm patches. He was wearing a white mask for COVID below his nose. He was aggressively panhandling on both dates. On March 24th he stood in font of my black SUV car, slammed on the hood of the car with his fists at least two (2) times while displaying his middle finger to me with the other hand. He was screaming and yelling profanity while doing this. After I parked my car I went to take a picture of him with my phone from a distance. I was standing on Herald Street and he ran across traffic on Albany street toward Herald and began to follow me down Herald Street screaming and yelling at me the entire time. I spoke with a Boston Police Officer doing a detail on Harrison Ave., and he called the duty supervisor from D-4. Eventually, this matter was assigned to Det. Nucci (617-343-9529). On April 7, 2021, I contacted Det. Nucci because I saw the same man at that intersection doing the same thing to the cars around mine. Hopefully you will be able to locate the man on the surveillance. I have one photo of him but unfortunately my cellphone camera is not compatible with my computer. I will try to send it to you from my phone so you will have a better picture of the man. Thank you for your attention to this matter, CiovO\"

Or, that the seven non-commissioners have finished their work as members, a final meeting has been held with them, and any remaining “group” now consists of the two commissioners working with staff to accomplish the Cottleville project? It would be helpful if you could clarify that. If a record has been made on this point, I would appreciate a complete copy of it. And likewise, of any record that was made, after February 23, to memorialize the designation of the “subcommittee” as an “advisory” or “working group,” rather than a “subcommittee.” I trust it’s understood that I am not asking you to comment about whether the seven non-commissioners have any plans to meet in the future, on their own private initiative.

Thank you in advance for the help, QUESTIONS 1. What was BPD’s maximum age for new recruits when Rose was hired on June 22, 1994? 2. If Rose was above that maximum age, what was BPD’s basis or authorization for hiring Rose at age 39? Can I get a copy of any document explaining the basis or authorization? 3. Did Rose receive a waiver from the age requirement because of military service? If so, can I get details? How many years of military service did he get credit for? What branch of service? 4. Is there a form DD214 in Rose’s personnel file documenting his military service? If so, can I get a copy? Did Rose get civil service preference because of his military experience? 5. Was a home rule petition or other law or ordinance passed exempting Rose from the age requirement? If so, who sponsored the law and what are the details of the law? 6. Can I get details of Rose’s previous employment, including military service, included in Rose’s file? If there is a document showing Rose’s previous employment and/or military service can you please provide? 7.Can I get the details and results of any background investigation or recruit investigative file or report? If there are documents, can I get copies? 8. Does Rose’s file show if he has previously applied to the BPD before he was ultimately hired in June 1994? If so, can I get the number of times Rose applied and the dates of the applications? 9. Does Rose’s file show the number of times Rose took the civil service exam to become a police officer? If so, how many times did he pass and how many times did he fail before he was hired? 10. Can we get the details on Rose’s recruit class. What was his academy class number?

Expedited processing I am requesting expedited processing. I believe this request is entitled to such processing because I am a member of the media, employed as a journalist by The New York Times where my role is primarily engaged in disseminating information to the public. This request also warrants expedited processing because it seeks to enhance the public’s understanding of government activity around which there is widespread and exceptional media and public interest. These records relate to issues around police operations and financial spending, which has been an issue of national attention for the past 11 months. Police budgets can occupy a large part of a city budget, with overtime costs running particularly high in light of recent protests. A greater understanding of overtime pay would greatly contribute to the public’s understanding of this important government activity. Fee Waiver I am also requesting a fee waiver. A fee waiver is warranted because the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor.

I am responding to the question asked of him in the public information request response he received on May 6. We are all abutters of Acorn Street and part of the Acorn Street Association and have asked Todd Liming for his assistance in understanding what we can do to reduce tourist traffic on our private way. Todd hasn't responded and it is our understanding that certain organizations including the Beacon Hill Civic Association have been in contact with him to oppose any limitation on local traffic on our private way. The level of tourist traffic has grown geometrically over the past decade if not past five years and we are overwhelmed with the hordes of people posing in our doorways and impeding our ability to enter and leave our own homes. We are united in our interest in a gate on either end of Acorn Street that would remain unlocked for local traffic but send a clear message to tourists that this isn't just an instagram photo opportunity but the property of local citizens who have ever right to protect their property and their home values from constant encroachment. We presented our case to the Architectural Commission and they referred it back to the PIC so we really need some clarification from Todd Liming and his staff about what would be acceptable as a form of tourist mitigation on Acorn. We understand a gate was allowed on Willow Court and we are hoping that an unlocked gate might be more acceptable once the reality of Acorn's tourist problem is better understood by the city. I hope this clarifies what we are looking for; any communication with any organization or entity on the topic of Acorn Street and any clarification from the PIC of what form of gate might be acceptable on either end of the private way. Thank you!

A spreadsheet, e.g., Microsoft Excel, or other flat file format, e.g., Comma-separated Values (CSV) or Tab-separated Values (TSV), containing as many of the following fields of data as are stored in any electronic record system or software pertaining to each time the Boston Police Department or an employee thereof has been sued for actions or omissions committed in the course of employment after 2010: a. Employment identification number of officer-defendant b. Last name of officer defendant c. First name of officer defendant d. Badge number of officer defendant e. Case caption f. Docket number g.

Amount of money, if any, the city paid for legal representation of officer in this. 2. Any other document which lists lawsuits brought against the Boston Police Department or any employee thereof for acts or omissions committed in course of employment after 2010. 3. Each agreement signed by the city to settle claims against the Boston Police Department after 2010. 4. For each lawsuit listed, the following documents related to the underlying events and accusations: a. Any and all internal investigation reports (however named); b. Arrest reports; c. Use-of-force or other supplemental reports (however named); d. Any relevant body camera footage e. Findings of a disciplinary hearing board (however named); f. Discipline actually imposed by the Boston Police Department or other body; g. Any other documents relating to the Boston Police Department’s efforts to ascertain the truth of the accusations relayed in each lawsuit listed above. With respect to the form of production, we note that relevant regulations require the production of records in an accessible, commonly used electronic form, to the extent feasible. See 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). Record custodians are also required to implement new record keeping systems and databases in such a way as to allow for “retrieval of public portions of records to provide maximum public access.” See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(e). Extraction of such data from a database or electronic record system does not constitute creating a new record. See 950 CMR 32.07(1)(f). See also Attorney Gen. v. District Att'y for Plymouth Dist., 484 Mass. 260, 275 (2020) (“where public records are in electronic form, as they increasingly are and will be, a public records request that requires a government entity to search its electronic database to extract requested data does not mean that the extracted data constitute the creation of a new record under the public records law”). Printing these records from a database or electronic system, redacting them with a marker, and then re-scanning them, is generally not consistent with these regulations; this process provides the digital records in neither the preferred form nor in a “searchable machine- readable form.” 950 CMR 32.04(5)(d). If necessary, we welcome reasonable suggested modifications pursuant to 950 CMR 32.06(2)(g). If you believe that some portion of the documents requested are exempt from disclosure or require redaction, please release any reasonably segregable portions that are not exempt. In addition, please note the applicable statutory exemption and explain why it applies to the redacted portions. Please CiovO\"

During the protests following Floyd’s murder, and numerous other notable instances of policing activity, members of the media sought information from the Boston Police Department to inform their coverage of current events. Open The government requests documents to shed light on the policies that Boston Police Department’s public information officers follow when determining which media requests to answer and which information to release.

B001098-062421,2021-06-24,2021-06-25,BIS/VEU,"BIS/Video Evidence Unit Aidan Bruton Morgan & Morgan P.A. Our law firm represents Ms. Linh Phung Hua in the above legal matter. You may be in the possession of evidence that is important to this matter. Briefly, Ms. Linh Phung Hua suffered major injuries due to a pedestrian-motor vehicle accident that occurred at the intersection of Dorchester Ave and Adams St. in Dorchester, Massachusetts on or around 3:15 p.m. on March 31, 2021.We understand that you may have video footage of the accident location during that time, and we are requesting that you preserve that footage. The importance of immediate action cannot be overstated. Electronically stored information is easily corrupted, altered, and deleted in normal daily operations. Even booting a drive, running an application, or reviewing a document can permanently alter evidence. An important method for preserving data in its original state is to have a forensic image (mirror image or clone image) made of pertinent hard drives of both office and home computers used for business and of network servers. This image captures all current data, including the background or metadata about each document. Simply copying data to a CD-ROM or other common back-up medium is not adequate. For each captured image file, record and identify the person creating the image and the date of creation. Secure the file to prevent subsequent alteration or corruption and create a chain of custody log. Once the forensic data image file is created, the pertinent computer or other device can be placed back into operation. This preservation notice covers the above items and information between the following dates: March 31, 2021 - Present. Follow the above procedures to preserve electronic information created after this notice. Current law and rules of civil procedure clearly apply to the discovery of electronically stored information just as they apply to other evidence and confirm the duty to preserve such information for discovery. You and your officers, employees, agents, and affiliated organizations must take all reasonable steps to preserve this information until this legal matter is finally resolved. Failure to take the necessary steps to preserve the information addressed in this letter or other pertinent information in your possession or control may result in serious sanctions or penalties. To properly fulfill your preservation obligation, stop all scheduled data destruction,electronic shredding, rotation of backup tapes, and the sale, gift, or destruction of hardware.Notify all individuals and affiliated organizations of the need and duty to take the necessary affirmatives steps to comply with the duty to preserve evidence. Thank you for your cooperation. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns."
