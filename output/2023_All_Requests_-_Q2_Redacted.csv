I’m hoping to get a copy of the 911 dispatch audio from April 19, 2013 around 7:00pm. That’s when BPD Superintendent Bill Evans was at 67 Franklin Street, Watertown where he got word the suspect was hiding in a boat. He says 10 minutes later he heard 911 dispatch say they’re hearing communications the guy’s in the boat but Evans says he and other BPD officers were already there, they were waiting on tactical team, and he radio back “Yankee C3 I have the guy in the boat. So disregard the call.“ He says within several minutes of that call we’ll likely be able to hear him yelling for officers, he says self-reported to the scene, to hold their fire. Could we get a copy of that transmission please? Thank you so very much, Susan"

This again is one of those times that a public records request of BPS should have been entirely + unnecessary. 1) On March 13, 2023 — five weeks ago — I made the following request of Max Baker of the BPS press office. I would like to request a telephone interview with Superintendent [Mary] Skipper to discuss sexual misconduct, bullying, and other equity matters at BPS. 2) On March 13, 2023, Mr. Baker responded to me as follows. As for your second point, let me speak to her scheduler and try and get some time on the calendar. Supt. Skipper is pretty busy so it might take some time to schedule. That said, if you provide me with some written questions, I can provide responses to you that come from the superintendent. What is your timeline? 3) On March 13, 2024, I respond to Mr. Baker as follows. I like to stay away from interviews by email. Instead, I like to have contemporaneous discussions that lead to conversational responses and, at the same time, avoid countless back and forth emails. 4) When I did not hear back from Mr. Baker, I wrote the following to him on March 31, 2023. It’s been over two weeks since you said that you would try to arrange an interview for me with Superintendent Skipper. 5) On April 3, 2023, Mr. Baker responded to me as follows. I am still working on that. She is quite busy I'm afraid. 6) On April 3, 2023, I responded to Mr. Baker as follows. Of course Superintendent Skipper is busy. She will alway be busy in her job. I have had difficulty before in arranging to speak with BPS about sexual misconduct. 7) When I did not hear back from Mr. Baker, I wrote the following to him on April 9, 2023. It’s been nearly a month since you told me that you would try to arrange an interview for me with Superintendent Skipper to discuss sexual misconduct, bullying, and other “equity matters.” In that regard I cannot imagine a more important topic for Superintendent Skipper to address. So I want to ask you the status of my request for the interview? 8) When I still did not hear back from Mr. Baker, I wrote the following to him on April 12, 2023. I am following up on the voicemail message that I just left for you, and the email below to which I have not received a response. If Superintended Skipper does not wish to speak with me on the subject of sexual misconduct, bullying. and related “equity” matters, please just tell me that. 9) Mr. Baker remained silent. 10) I would liked to gain an understanding of why Superintendent Skipper has not granted me an interview on the critical matter of sexual misconduct, bullying, and other equity matters at BPS. 11) Accordingly, please provide me with copies of any and all communications related to my efforts to obtain an interview with Superintendent Skipper regarding sexual misconduct, bullying, and other equity matters at BPS. Communications include, but are not limited to, emails, texts, letters, memoranda, faxes, and/or notes.

B001218-042023,2023-04-20,2023-04-20,BPD Media Relations,"kate gallagher This is what we’re working off of here. -Kate Tyre Extinguishers FIRST ACTION IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS: 43 SUVS DISARMED 20/04/2023 The environmental activist group Tyre Extinguishers Boston has deflated the tires of 43 luxury SUVs in the Beacon Hill Neighborhood. On Wednesday night, the climate activists deflated the tires of 43 luxury SUVs around the neighborhood of Beacon Hill. The group took this action to render the large greenhouse gas emitting vehicles unusable, directly preventing the outpouring of emission from the vehicles into our atmosphere which further contribute to climate change and air pollution. Only large, luxury, gas powered SUVs were targeted by the group; no tires were deflated on electric or hybrid vehicles nor any vehicles with handicap signage. The group left leaflets on the cars to inform the owners about why their vehicle was impacted, imploring them to stop using their SUVs and switch to public transportation, biking, or smaller compact electric and hybrid cars. The activists state that SUVs are a dangerous and unnecessary environmental atrocity, especially in city environments where there are sustainable transport options available to everyone. According to a report by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT)(1), SUVs emit an average of 34% more carbon dioxide (CO2) over their lifecycle compared to a typical compact car. Moreover, according to the same organization (2), combustion engine vehicles emit 150% more greenhouse gases over their lifecycle compared to battery operated electric vehicles. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety conducted a study(3) on the risk of pedestrian fatalities associated with different types of vehicles, including SUVs and compact cars. The study found that SUVs were 2-3 times more likely to cause pedestrian fatalities than passenger cars in collisions at speeds between 20-39 mph. According to The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) (4), drivers of SUVs are 28% more likely to die in an accident, mostly due to the fact that SUVs are three times as likely to roll over in accidents than standard cars. According to MassDOT transportation records (5), at least 430 people died on public roadways in Massachusetts during 2022, which marks the second consecutive year that the Commonwealth has broken a new record for traffic fatalities. At least 109 of those deaths were individuals on foot, in a wheelchair, or on a bicycle. This problem is only going to get worse, as according to the IEA (6), SUVs made up 27% of the total car sales in 2010, and that skyrocketed to 48% in 2018. Individually owned luxury vehicles are not permissible if we are to reach our climate goals in the state or if we want to keep the residents of the Greater Boston Area safe. The activists took this action in Beacon Hill as it is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Boston to own a house. According to an Oxfam report in 2020 (7), the world’s wealthiest 10% were responsible for about 50% of global emissions in 2015 and the top 1% are responsible for as much emissions as the world’s poorest 50%, who will feel the brunt of climate impacts in terms of climate change and pollution despite contributing the least to the cause. The climate crisis is an environmental justice issue and the solutions to the crisis must prioritize marginalized and poor demographics and primarily reduce the emissions from the world’s wealthy. It is not an exaggeration to say that the richest individuals in the world are causing the current and future deaths of the less fortunate and less developed nations and people. Tyre Extinguishers is a global activist movement with members in 15 countries, claiming to have deflated more than 10,000 SUV tires since March 2022 (8). Kate Gallagher Sr. Editor in Cha"

I am particularly interested in examining the data with regards to how and to what extent the policy affected parents vs single individuals and if there were any particular trends regarding age or gender as to their experience with the hybrid work schedule. Ideally, I would appreciate a summary of the findings to each question, however, as my interest also lies with examining answers to open ended questions and determining how they relate to age and marital status, I would also gladly examine the raw data sets. As this is an academic related request, I will share any findings with whomever you determine most appropriate in your department. Please note, there are no plans for the publishing of this information. It will be supplemental towards the goal of understanding how COVID-19 and subsequent hybrid work models have affected the work/life balance of individuals and whether the effects can vary across genders.

R001604-050423,2023-05-04,2023-06-09,Public Works,"Bonnie Donohue Hello. You recently supplied me with five records I requested with a Reference Number of R001367-041423. The first three of the five are of interest to me. They are CIP 17-24, Sheet 5 of 5, Sheet 6 of 5, and Sheet 7 of 5. They are dated 7/20/2017. These are drawings of the proposed renovations on Summer Street, focused on the A Street overpass bridge, part of the $14 million project. I note that the work that was completed in 2019 has a few slight variations from the proposed project. Therefore, I assume that there were revised drawings made after 2017. I would appreciate it if you could supply me with the updated versions of those three documents. For example, the drawings show a 3-foot buffer zone between the curb and the bike lane, with scored concrete between the curb and a barrier rail; however, the 18-inch-wide buffer has a different kind of concrete installed -- not scored concrete -- which I cannot identify, and I'd like to know what that concrete is called. I would like to get a granular view of any adjustments to the final plans that reflect what was actually installed. If there is a text version that describes what's in the drawings, I'd like that as well. I've dropped a photo of the 3-foot buffer zone that shows the 18""-wide concrete strip that is definitely not scored concrete. Thank you!"

Earlier this year, we requested a public-research researcher to find out the history of Eldred ""Max"" Hiscock, the park's namesake. He was a homeless man who lived on the stoop of 159 W Newton St., where he also died in 1970. (He was born in 1907 in Franklin County, ME, and moved to Boston in 1952.) The owners of #159 had helped him obtain Social Security and opened a joint bank account for him from which they paid him $3 each day. In the fall, Max regularly would disappear, picked up under a vagrancy law, to ""dry out"" in Bridgewater State Hospital where he would also have a daily meal and a warm bed. The attached report (A Brief History of Hiscock Park) fills out many details except for one: No pictures were found of him in records searched so far. Bridgewater State's records are in disarray. Does the BPD have a mug shot or other photo or visual record of Eldred Max Hiscock? I hope so. Thank you."

We want to understand the full scope of your efforts, not just the portions funded by the grant, if possible. Here is the information we have been given by BJA based on what you submitted: Sum of SAKs inventoried: 1,701 Sum of SAKs sent for testing: 0 Sum of CODIS hits: 0 Sum of victims contacted: 3 Sum of investigations opened: 2 Sum of cases charged: 2 Sum of convictions, including plea bargains: 0 Based on some of the media coverage I’ve seen of your SAK program, I believe several of these stats are likely undercounts. Can you please provide us with accurate totals for each of these lines? Also, if you have any documentation regarding these stats, or other outcomes from your grant, that you think it would be helpful for us to see, feel free to provide it as well. Additionally, we have a few questions regarding your grant program we are hoping you can answer. Which law enforcement agencies provided kits that were tested as a part of this grant? How many cases have been forwarded for prosecution? If you track them individually by case number, can you provide us that list? Finally, if there is something you’d like us to know about a particular accomplishment or challenge of your SAKI, or a specific case you’d like to highlight, please let me know. We are hoping to collect this information by June 14. If only some information is available by then, please send what you have and provide an approximate timeline for providing the other information.

Burke High School Community, I am writing to inform you that the Boston Police Department is investigating the fraudulent enrollment of an adult woman who used falsified identification and paperwork to register as a student this academic year. This individual has been discharged and is being ordered to stay away from Boston Public Schools (BPS) facilities. At various points during the 2022-2023 school year, this individual attended the Jeremiah E. Burke High School, Brighton High School, and English High School utilizing the student transfer process and enrolling under multiple pseudonyms. Last week a BPS staff member observed irregularities in the paperwork on file and reported it to District leadership, who immediately contacted Boston Police. While the investigation is in its early stages and remains ongoing, school officials have not identified any incidents of harm to students or staff. At this time families of students who may have interacted with this individual are being contacted directly by school staff and investigators. We will provide additional updates if relevant information becomes available through the investigation. Mary Skipper Superintendent Boston Public Schools"

However, he has refused to provide me with copies of his work, saying that he would “respond in more detail when I’m able.” My concern is that this promised “respon[se] in more detail” will only come at the 11th hour just before construction begins and it is too late to affect the City’s plans. Accordingly, I request electronic copies of the following: 1. Any studies, analyses, evaluations, and communications concerning Back Bay bike lanes over the past 12 months, including but not limited to emails, memos, and presentations sent, prepared, or received by Franklin-Hodge or his team members (collectively, “work”). 2. In addition to work related to implementing an optimal Back Bay bike plan, any work related to the impact of the bike lane plans on abutters, traffic congestion, safety, the ability to find parking spaces, and pollution. 3. Supporting data analyses that the City used as inputs for its plans. Including Excel files. 4.Studies or database information regarding vehicular/bike/pedestrian accident incidence on key Back Bay Intersections and along the A/B Beacon block. 5. Post- 2017 Back Bay parking meter capacity utilization studies. [I already have a copy of the City’s 2017 presentations to the Back Bay community.] 6. Analyses of the cost of the City’s bike lane construction plans and the prospective reduction in parking meter fees. 7. Analyses of the financial impact of the City’s plans on reduced abutter property valuations and property taxes. I do not need intersection traffic counts at this time, since BTD has provided me with counts it commissioned in October 2022. For earlier reports, I have access to the ScerIS ETCETERA database. Rather I need to see any analyses performed by City traffic engineers using this information. If any supporting analyses were created in Excel workbooks, my ability to understand them will require access to the underlying formulas – particularly if the workbooks involve multiple worksheets or contains external cell references. Accordingly, I ask that I receive any Excel files in read-only .xlxs format. Given that Franklin- Hodge has stated that he plans to begin bike lane construction this fall, this records request is time sensitive. [SPR23/1728]"
