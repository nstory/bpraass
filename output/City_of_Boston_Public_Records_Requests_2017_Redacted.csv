Jeffrey N. Roy (“Rep. Roy”) was elected to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts House of Representatives for the 10th Norfolk District. On January 15, 2015 Rep. Roy presented to the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in General Court (“the Massachusetts legislature”) assembled, a petition for the accompanying bill [H.B. No. 1566] entitled An Act relative to electronic publication of legal notices. 2. As a result of H.B. No. 1566, On July 25, 2016 it became Massachusetts law that if a person is required by a statute to publish a legal notice in a newspaper or newspaper of general circulation, the person shall ensure that the legal notice appears in a newspaper’s print publication. See M.G.L. c. 4 § 13. However, the Massachusetts legislature provided that this act shall not take effect until 180 days after passage. See St. 2016, c. 174 § 2. 3. Thus, M.G.L. c. 4 § 13 did not take effect until January 21, 2017. 4. As you know, on May 28, 1930 the Massachusetts legislature granted the Police Commissioner of the City of Boston exclusive authority to make rules and orders for regulation of hackney carriages (taxicabs) and hackney stands (taxicab stands) within the city limits of Boston. St. 1930, c. 392 § 1. Pursuant to this 1930 taxicab statute, “Such rules and orders shall not take effect until they have been published at least once in a newspaper published in said city.” Id. (Emphasis added). 5. Boston Police Department rule 403 (“Rule 403”) was promulgated by the Police Commissioner of the City of Boston with “inten [t] to be a comprehensive and definitive listing of all regulations affecting the Hackney Carriage industry in the City of Boston as of August 29, 2008.” See Rule 403 § 1(II)(c). 6. By letter dated September 6, 2013 you responded to a Public Records Request dated April 30, 2013 seeking information regarding publication of Rule 403 in a newspaper pursuant to Massachusetts law. In your September 6, 2013 response, you contended that “[a]fter diligent search, the Department was unable to” confirm publication of Rule 403 in a newspaper, as contemplated by the 1930 City of Boston taxicab law. See: Page twelve (12) of fourteen (14) page pdf formatted file attachment transmitted herewith. 7. On July 15, 2014 Boston Police Captain James Gaughan (“Gaughan”) confirmed Rule 403 had not been published in a newspaper, as contemplated by the 1930 City of Boston taxicab law. 8. According to court papers filed August 8, 2014 in civil action no. 13-cv-10769 the pending in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, “Gaughan asserted he was advised by Boston Police Department ‘lawyers’” about Rule 403 not being published in a newspaper, as contemplated by the 1930 City of Boston taxicab law."

This is the spreadsheet you emailed me on February 17, 2017. It contains 7 transfers between November 28, 2016 and February 3, 2017, inclusive. You have represented that these 7 transfers were the only transfers made between these two dates. 3. On February 17, 2017 you emailed me a pdf of a spreadsheet in violation of the Public Records Law requiring live, machine readable documents. I will waive this requirement for the request you sent me on February 17, 2017. HOWEVER, from this day forward you are required by law to provide LIVE spreadsheets. You have emailed me dead spreadsheets in the past, some of them very large. I had to ask Dan Koh to intervene in order for you to send me LIVE spreadsheets. 4. Fulfilling my identical requests in the past has resulted in you sending me an approximate average of 36 single-sided pages for each transfer by mail. 5. The entire set of documents for each transfer is based on the checklist of necessary documents listed on the letter summarizing each request you provide in each Medallion File. Because you check the documents included in the File against your checklist the documents are in the same order as the checklist in the File and the set you’ve sent me. Given all of the above, please confirm that this new request does NOT require any incremental “research” or “analysis” to my requests with identical specifications referred to in one of your previous responses. That was the first time you mentioned this additional “research” or “analysis.” 6. The “redaction” necessary to fulfill this request is identical to my previous requests and solely requires only blacking out non-publicly available phone numbers, addresses and bank account numbers of principals in the transfers. 7. You’ve requested and I’ ve paid a total of $12.90 to receive these documents. 8. My Check #96 for $12.90 to the City of Boston was written on 5/11/2016 and cleared on 6/2/2016. 9. Besides this $12.90 you’ve never requested any additional payments for these documents totaling approximately 1,400 single-sided pages. 10.

B000178-032317,2017-03-22,2017-03-29,OPC,"Mr. Chris Marzilli Is the Department's homicide division also organized by district? If this is the case, does each district's homicide division work separately in separate headquarters? Has this always been the case (keeping in mind my story is set in 1978)? -Roughly how many officers does the Department employ as homicide detectives specifically? More importantly, how many did it employ as homicide detectives in 1978 (per capita, average, or even just a few select samples from the late '70's will do)? Exact numbers would be very appreciated, but are not entirely necessary, as an informed estimate is far more precise than anything I might manage to come upon. -If the homicide divisions of the Department were and are organized by district, does this occasionally result in a conflict over jurisdiction or has that never been an issue? Though my story does not involve corruption in any way, I was considering including a small conflict within the Department over exactly which district the murder was committed in, and thus, whose responsibility the ensuing investigation is, but do not want to include it if such an event is inaccurate and seemingly offensive to the virtue of those who served during my targeted timed period. -Did special task forces exist within the Department during the late 70's, like those now that, for instance, investigate sex crimes? Roughly how many detectives would be assigned to such a task force, and how would the task force go about investigating a murder? Would it be the classic (possibly cliché) pair of detectives or would it have been a more collaborative effort?"

B000225-041117,2017-04-06,2017-05-12,BPD Legal Advisor,"Robert Azulay Hello my name is Robert. I don't mean to intrude on your work in the department. I have been doing research lately on the missing persons around the Boston area in which bodies of young men have been showing up in the Charles River. I personally have a few theories and I'm sure you and your team does as well on this subject. I am not related to any media whatsoever. Im investigating on my own time and expense and i have come to a few conclusions that over the past 10 to 15 years, according to reports online, that there may very well be a serial killer in the area or a killer crossing state lines traveling coast to coast through the mid west. I am offering a helping hand in the investigation. Heres a brief summary about me and why i am deciding to contact you for information. Serial killers have long been a subject of study in my life since i was young. in my life i have studied numerous american serial killers, and watched many hours of interviews on youtube and cold cases, read many psychology books and studied common factors in and out of the minds of psychopaths. In order to catch a killer in this day and age i believe you have to think like a killer in the sense of motive and who what where when how and why. I personally believe that this killer is quite local however he may also be traveling through mid western states committing the same crimes. I feel like this assailent is very very close to the traits of serial killer Tommy Lynn Sells, in the aspect that he was compulsive and he traveled coast to coast in his killing spree. Tommy was a brutal malicious murderer. In this case the bodies in the charles seem to have no physical trauma or damage, i believe, correct me if im wrong. some of the bodies have contained drugs and alcohol in the autopsy reports? some have no trace of drugs or alcohol, leading me to believe that someone is mainly staging them to be deemed an accident or suicide. possibly drugging the victims till passed out and disposing half alive victims to drown in the water until death. also i researched high and low tides and according to charts multiple bodies at different times have appeared between the airport and the North end. I concluded on my own that the dumping may have happened between the areas of quincy and cohassett. I am unsure tho. these are just theories would i be able to learn more about this situation through the boston police department? and would i be able to access certain reports on this case?"

At the time of the crash I took down what I believed to be the license number of the truck that hit me: Arizona AH24623.The driver left the scene before I could secure information on license and registration. On Monday, July 10, 2017, I filed a claim with U-Haul's insurer, repwest of Phoenix, AZ. The insurer has since denied the claim, asserting that the vehicle with that registration was in the Nashville, TN, area at the time of my incident. On July 14, 2017, I filed reports with the Boston Police and Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles regarding this incident. Repwest says my claim cannot move forward unless I provide additional evidence that the truck in question was indeed in the Boston area. I am hoping you can search your database to see if the vehicle that struck me might have been involved in other local incidents. Here are the numbers I am hoping you can search. The first number is the one I believe to be correct. The others I have suggested just in case I inadvertently transposed some numbers. Arizona AH24623 (This is the number I believe to be correct.)

My alleged father Peter Andrew(s)/ Theodore P. Andrew(s) according to my mother is named Peter Andrew(s), at the time of her marriage to was 37 years old in 1958, putting his date of birth at . According to my mother at time my father Peter Andrew(s) was arrested by the Boston Police Department a number of times while residing at I was born in the year of , so the information regarding the arrest of Peter Andrew(s) would be applicable between 1956 through 1964, and the arrest would involve domestic violence assault and public intoxication. Again, my reasons are to find out whether the man who married my mother Annie Lou Drayton in 1958 is Peter Andrew(s) or Theodore P. Andrew(s). Because I have reason to believe contrary, as a direct result of my sister's birth certificate list her father as Theodore P. Andrew(s), However, my mother's marriage certificate list the man she married as Peter Andrew(s) with his list as Joseph Andrew(s) and Mother as Mary Pina.

I am requesting the ""Calls for Service"" from our reporting area and the adjacent reporting areas since September 1st, 2017. We would also like to go back 2-3 years to show crime trends in the area; our focus is violent crime, car accidents involving pedestrians, and anything else that you think would be pertinent. Right now, our dismissal procedure begins at 4:10pm, many times not finishing until almost 6pm since the buses are usually very late. This means that our students are going home in the dark for a significant portion of the school year. We are concerned about the safety of our students and families who walk home or take public transportation; sixth graders are no longer allowed to ride the regular school buses so many of our 6th, 7th and 8th graders walk to the Roxbury Crossing train stop to get home. They need to cross some busy streets in the dark, including Tremont Street. I know that there have been at least a couple of shootings in close proximity to our school since September (one at the Tobin Community Center and one near Fuentes Market during an ice cream social right before winter break). Those shootings took place on the exact route that many of our students walk after school. As you can imagine, students and their families are concerned about safety. For that reason, a group of parents, teachers, and other school staff are going to request that the school department change our dismissal time so that our students are going home while it is still light outside. We would greatly appreciate anything you can do to support us in our efforts to create a safer school day and lessen the concern of many parents."
