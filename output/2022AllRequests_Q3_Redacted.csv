It reveals the key steps that have contributed to some of the worst events in history. Each was caused by a catalogue of instances that we shine a fresh light on. Ultimately, it uncovers brand new revelations about some of the world’s biggest catastrophes. For one episode, we’re focusing on the Boston Marathon Bombings. We aim to weave archive footage with interviews from experts, witnesses, and survivors. In order to bring this story to life, we are gathering the strongest archive we can so that our viewers are informed and educated; all material is dealt with in a respectful and sensitive manner. In this spirit, I wonder if you'd be kind enough to share any Public Domain material the police department has from this event in a bid to inform and educate our viewers about this moment in history. We'd be looking to obtain any footage, audio, stills or reports that you have from this event in history. The Smithsonian is keen to shed light on this matter in a sensitive and respectful manner. Any guidance you could provide would be most appreciated. Best wishes, Katie Katie McGrath Archive Producer Blink Films, Bankstock Building, 42-44 De Beauvoir Crescent, London N1 5SB"

Her sister said O`NEILL told her she was going to kill herself by taking PERNICE`s prescription pills. Her sister said she had a history of suicidal ideations. Officers went to O`NEILL`s apartment, but she wasn`t home. BPD pinged her cell phone and it showed she was traveling so multiple agencies were notified. On or about 10/24/2021, O`NEILL attempted to extort PERNICE by threatening to divulge damaging personal information about him to the PGA Tour and others if she was not paid approximately $50,000, $25,000 that had been reversed in 06/2021 and an additional $25,000. Boston PD report #21-2065199. SPD extortion case #22-13722 (case disposition still pending); 11/27/2021: O`NEILL reported the same exact incident that MPD refused to take TWICE, to Boston PD. Boston PD took a report and charged PERNICE with two counts of ""intimidating a witness."" An interesting variation is seen. O`NEILL reported to MPD that PERNICE told her that if you don`t file the lawsuit and agree not to testify against me, I won`t file criminal charges against you for theft. O`NEILL reported to Boston PD he said, if you don`t file the lawsuit, I won`t file my report against you as long as you agree not to testify against me in any of the criminal stuff. I got a copy of the report and evidence. The 1st charge has no evidence to support it as she states he threatened her on a phone call that was not recorded, and no one was witness to. The second charge is based off him texting her, ""Just drop it. I`m not going to file any charges against you as long as you don`t keep going w/ all your ridiculous accusations against me to the police. Easy. Stop. And go on in your life."" There is no mention of a lawsuit or testifying as O`NEILL falsely reported. I noted O`NEILL had sent several texts to PERNICE prior to his text and I was alarmed to see a partial text from her that stated, ""private and damaging information to the Tour and others if her monetary demands are not"" which lends to his claims she is trying to extort him.

He was allegedly among a group of three individuals who were present in the area of Polk Street near Charlestown High School on June 13, as the school’s graduation festivities was underway. The three encountered a larger group of approximately eight individuals at approximately 3:53 p.m. Within three minutes, members of Resende’s group opened fire on the larger group. One member of the larger group returned fire. The shooting sent frantic graduates, loved ones and school staff fleeing from Charlestown High School’s graduation ceremony. No gun shot injuries were reported, but two vehicles sustained damage from the hail of bullets. One bullet went through a building’s exterior wall and into an apartment inside. Fortunately, no one was in the apartment at the time and no injuries occurred. Detectives were able to identify Resende from security footage and located his current address in Brockton. A search warrant executed at the residence resulted in the recovery of a 9mm Glock 26 semi-automatic firearm. Thanks very much. rgds jre"

Ch. 66 Section 10 is for information from the General Election held on November 3, 2020. I am requesting a text, comma, or tab delimited file, or a text-based report, listing, in the sequence processed by the city/town for every ballot, its sequential ID, its timestamp, its method of voting (for example: in-person, mail-in, provisional, absentee, ""other"", etc. – any ballots that were tabulated as part of the 2020 General Election), the specific votes contained for all races, and the batch ID and tabulator ID. Should any fields not be available, please include the fields which are. To be clear, I am NOT requesting a summary report of votes, I am requesting a per- ballot report. This set of information is sometimes known as a ""Cast Vote Record"" (CVR), ""ballot log"", or a ""summary of ballots"". If the data exists as multiple files or reports, for instance by batch or by precinct, you do not need to aggregate them, please send the individual files. I specifically do NOT want any information that identifies a specific voter, and I guarantee and stipulate that this information will not be used for that purpose. A report of this type would have very likely already been created when you audited the election results. If not, and you are not readily familiar with how to generate this report, you can refer to the instructions outlined in Chapter 14 of the Dominion User Guide. For your convenience, here are the steps: 1. Navigate to the Actions menu, click the Export menu item and click the CVR Export sub-menu item. 2. The CVR Export screen will appear. 3. Select criteria for filters if applicable, or leave as ALL in case no filter is required. 4. Perform additional settings, if applicable: • Create separate file per batch - check this if the export should create a separate export file for each results batch being exported. NOTE: This setting does not apply to the tabulator format, but only is used when exporting the JSON format. NOTE: If the number of batches is larger than 100, we strongly recommend that this option is used, otherwise the resulting file could be too large to produce (depending on system and project configuration). • Published batches - only check this if the export should only contain data from published result batches. (Please leave this unchecked) • Use tabular format - If this option is selected the export will be in the form of a tabular text file format, which can be opened in Excel instead of the default JSON format. (Please leave this unchecked) I would prefer the files in .JSON format (there should 16 separate JSON files, unless you choose to export separate files per batch, in which case there will be more), but if that is not possible, then the tabular format will be acceptable. I am hopeful that there is someone within the clerks or records office who will be able to generate the report I am looking for. Since this request is for information that will be used for educational purposes, and is NOT INTENDED FOR COMMERCIAL USE, I would like to also respectfully request that any fees be waived. Ideally, I would like to receive the report via electronic transmission. However, if the data file is too large, and must be copied to a USB drive, I will happily supply the necessary device to the county in order to make that happen. I would like to thank you in advance for your assistance with my request. Sincerely, Michael Dennis"

All documents including but not limited to agreements, procurement records and contracts between your agency and: Arxys, Big Data, BriefCam, CivicEye, Clearview AI, CommandCentral Aware, Downlink, Flock Safety, Fusus, Geolitica, HunchLab, Justice & Security Strategies, Motorola Solutions, Neural Magic, Palantir, PredPol, Ring, Rosebud.AI, ShotSpotter, Shotspotter Connect, Shotspotter Missions, SecuroNet, Safelink, Fog Reveal or Fog Data Science. 2. All documents including but not limited to agreements, procurement records and any other contracts at the Boston Police Department that include software or hardware described with any of the following terms: “Algorithm,” “algorithmic,” “artificial intelligence,” “data-driven policing,” “evidence-based policing,” “intelligence-led policing,” “precision policing,” or “predictive policing.” I would like to receive responsive records in digital format, for example as .PDF files via email. I also ask that responsive records be released on a rolling basis as they are ready. I am making this request as a reporter with The Associated Press as part of newsgathering and not for commercial use. I ask that you waive any and all applicable fees because releasing this information is in the public interest as it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities, specifically how law enforcement uses technology to inform policing. If you deny this request for a fee waiver, please advise me in advance of the estimated charges if they are to exceed $25. I also ask that you provide expedited review, as this is a matter of urgency. Delaying release of the information harms the public interest in knowing what tools law enforcement is using, and whether such tools build in bias in patrols, investigations and other surveillance. Delaying the release of the information harms the public interest by (i) preventing consistent public policy from being enacted in response to public safety; (ii) withholding key information from the public, as well as from government officials; and (iii) cloaking your agency’s policy responses in secrecy. Finally, as the world's oldest and largest news organization, the AP is a credible requester. I certify that my statements concerning the need for expedited review are true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. If you deny expedited processing, I expect to receive a response to the request within 10 days, as the statute requires. As I am making this request as a journalist and the information is of timely value, I would appreciate your communicating with me by telephone at 415.407.4338 or e-mail at gburke@ap.org if you have questions regarding this request. I look forward to your prompt response and thank you for your assistance. Sincerely, Garance Burke"

Amendments to contracts require review by several City Departments, which can take time. 2) Is Boston Public Schools planning to pay the balance? Yes. Thank you."

R002911-101122,2022-09-26,2022-10-27,Inspectional Services,"David Kelston Adkins, Kelston & Zavez, P.C. Dear Commissioner: I am writing on behalf of property manager GTI Properties, Inc., 450 Harrison Avenue owner SoWa North LLC, and Mario Nicosia, GTI and SoWa's principal, to make a formal complaint against Building Inspector David Johnson, and also to make a formal public records request related to a recent incident involving Inspector Johnson. The specifics are as follows. On Friday, September 23, 2022, at or around 10:30 a.m., Mr. Nicosia received information from GTI staff that Building Inspector Johnson had telephoned GTI' s on-call number regarding a complaint of work in progress at 450 Harrison Avenue, and that Inspector Johnson was waiting in the 450 Harrison lobby. (450 Harrison Avenue is a four-story masonry building with 93,000 square feet of commercial space consisting primarily of artist studios and galleries.) Mr. Nicosia and his Controller, Marc Julien, promptly went to the 450 Harrison building and met Inspector Johnson in the lobby. Inspector Johnson was from the inception of the meeting hostile, confrontational, and discourteous. Mr. Nicosia began the meeting by saying there is no work going on at 450 Harrison A venue. Inspector Johnson replied that the complaint he received was not about work - despite his phone call - but instead had something to do with illegal occupancy on the ground level of 450 Harrison Avenue. Mr. Nicosia replied that the tenant in that space, Vintage Market, had been there for about ten years and the occupancy was legal. It appears that Mr. Johnson may then have started to suggest that access to the Vintage space was not handicap compliant, but Mr. Nicosia interjected that the premises met grandfathering requirements. Inspector Johnson, who kept changing the basis of the complaint he supposedly received and/or what he wished from Nicosia, then demanded access to Vintage Market's space. Mr. Nicosia responded that he had no right to enter Vintage's space without prior approval from the tenant (such immediate access would be allowed only in an emergency situation), but Mr. Nicosia did offer to walk Inspector Johnson through the extensive common hallway areas of 450 Harrison Avenue. Inspector Johnson refused this offer and left the site at 10:56 a.m. in what can only be characterized as a huff, rudely refusing even to shake Mr. Nicosia's outstretched hand. In sum, Inspector Johnson was inappropriately demanding, aggressive and hostile, and perhaps worse, kept changing the reason he was even at the site and what he wanted and why. Commissioner, if there was any complaint of any kind in existence on September 23, 2022, concerning the property located at 450 Harrison A venue, please consider this letter a request pursuant to M.G.L. c. 66, § 10 for all records made or received concerning that complaint, and please provide them to me pursuant to the statute's requirement for production of records within ten (10) business days. My office will pay any fees or costs that may be owed pursuant to 950 CMR § 32.06. Additionally, whether a complaint exists or not (and we doubt the existence of any such complaint), please take steps to require Inspector Johnson to act appropriately to treat the citizens, property owners, and the taxpayers of Boston in a courteous and appropriate manner. Thank you very much, and I look forward to prompt production of the records, if any."

What, if anything, is BPS leadership doing to see to it that the problems identified at the Mission Hill School in the Phase I report will not be repeated at other BPS schools? Have there been, for example, any changes in how BPS investigates sexual misconduct and bullying[?] Have there been any changes in the BPS Equity office?

Communications, in turn, include, but are not limited to, emails, text messages, letters, memoranda, faxes, and/or notes.

These records should include when the gun was recovered, the nature of the crime, where in Maine the gun was traced to, and time-to-crime periods. We seek records for open and closed cases. We would prefer to obtain the information, including docket numbers for each criminal charge, in an electronic spreadsheet(s) -- an Excel workbook, a delimited text file, or any other analyzable format; not a PDF -- or database export file(s) so that we can analyze it more efficiently.

If records that match our request are already available online, we would appreciate a link to those records. We request you waive any fees to disclose this information, as we seek this information in the public interest. I seek the records as a journalist working at Boston University under the supervision of Professor Maggie Mulvihill. Mulvihill and her students produce deeply-reported investigative stories published in The Boston Globe (example and example), the Associated Press (example and example), the Crime Report (example) and in collaboration with The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism (example and example).

We are seeking this information for non-commercial use, as part of a routine newsgathering process. We expect to use it to prepare and publish news stories distributed to the public in your state. We believe the records we are requesting will help the public in your state better understand the operations of your agency.
