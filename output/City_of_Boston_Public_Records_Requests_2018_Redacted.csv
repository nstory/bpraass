Gray was shown announcing Verifone's selection as exclusive vendor for installation and support of the Taxicab Smart Meter System Project... [which was slated to] result in all 6,5000 District cabs being equipped with integrated Verifone systems...including driver tablet, credit card acceptance device and passenger information tablet display, as well as back office management system."" On November 21, 1991 the U.S. Congress expressly found ""additional remedies under Federal law [we]re needed to deter unlawful harassment and intentional discrimination in the workplace...by expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.""

The conspiracy against the rights secured to , as well as and other City of Boston Hackney Carriage Drivers (St. 1930, c. 392 § 3), under the Constitution and laws of the United States is hereby contended to be based in part upon the August 29, 2008 establishment, maintenance and enforcement of Boston Police Department Rule 403 (""Rule 403"") under color of Massachusetts law.

Therefore, the obvious distinction between (1) ""hackney carriage""; (2) ""hackney stand""; and (3) ""hackney driver"" under St. 1930, c. 392 § 2, or otherwise, cannot be ignored (under color of Massachusetts law) to intentionally discriminate against a class of predominately colored/immigrant City of Boston workers in employment opportunities by impairing our right to the equal benefit of the constitutional protection otherwise provided by the U.S. Congress to all citizens regardless of race, color or national origin to ""make and enforce a contract"" with the City of Boston, as contemplated by St. 1885, c. 266 § 6 - (""the mayor... shall...make all necessary contracts for the employment of labor"" say for instance to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990).

For each individual UCR Part I offense known to police, please provide the following data fields: *The incident number of the offense *Incident/offense date *Type of offense *Unfounded (yes/no), i.e. whether or not determined to be false or baseless complaint *Unfounded Date, if applicable *Clearance Date, if applicable *Arrest Date, if applicable *Type of clearance (arrest / cleared by exceptional means, etc) *Exceptional clearance type, if applicable (offender died, victim uncooperative, offender deported, prosecutor declined case, etc.). It is our understanding your agency participates in the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program, and has for years regularly compiled and reported crime statistics in a manner that complies with the requirements of that program. For instance, the FBI’s UCR Handbook[ucr.fbi.gov] states that participating agencies must report the total number of offenses known to police, total number of unfounded reports, total number of actual offenses, total number of cases cleared by arrest or exceptional means, and other information. This request is asking for a copy of the underlying, incident-level data that is regularly accessed and used to compile statistical reports for purposes of complying with the requirements of the UCR program. We specifically request to receive the bulk of this information in a useable electronic format. Data records should be provided in a format such as a delimited text/CSV, or database file such as Microsoft Access database or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Data records should NOT be provided as a PDF file or other non-useable electronic format, nor on paper, without first checking with us. In the event you no longer have incident level data in electronic form going back to 2014, please provide as much electronic data as you do currently have in your possession. It is our intention to work with your agency on this request. We do not wish you to create any new sets of information, or to go to great lengths to re-create older information. In this spirit, to the extent that it is in any way easier on a technical end for you to fulfill this request by providing more information or more data fields (such as if your offense database can easily export all fields in certain tables), we would welcome more information about the incidents as well. Whatever is easiest on your end that still provides at least this minimal amount of requested data, is acceptable. If you have any technical questions, or if any aspect or manner in which we have requested this information proves difficult to process, we ask you reach out to us in advance of formally responding so we may work with you to make the response as easy as possible using as little staff time as possible. As this request is part of a larger national research project from Scripps News, and because we are asking for underlying data from statistical reports which are already regularly produced by your agency, we respectfully request you consider a public interest news media fee waiver for the release of the data."

I would love to hear more about the officers involved in the three criminal cases that were dismissed, as well as the internal investigation that was dismissed clearing an officer, all due to body camera footage obtained during the one-year pilot program that concluded last fall. In particular, here at the ed board we've been wondering what was the BPD's response when testimony by officers was undermined or even contradicted by body camera footage in court. Did that situation trigger any disciplinary action? If so, what kind? If not, why not? Additionally, like I said, I would love to find out more about that internal investigation that was thrown out by video evidence, and any other incident in which the footage from body cams worn during the pilot cleared police officers themselves."

Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, state and local law enforcement agencies assumed new counterterrorism responsibilities in addition to their traditional roles of investigating crimes and patrolling neighborhoods. Law enforcement agencies in virtually every major jurisdiction across the country now engage in a range of counterterrorism efforts designed to prepare for and foil terrorist attacks; these agencies have also increased their coordination and collaboration with their federal counterparts through fusion centers, task forces, and similar entities. In light of recent events suggesting possible increased surveillance of Muslim communities by various law enforcement agencies in the context of counterterrorism efforts, Muslim Advocates seeks information from the BPD. We hereby request the following records under MPRL: All memoranda of understanding, contracts, policy manuals, or executed agreements between the BPD and the Massachusetts Commonwealth Fusion Center and/or the Boston Regional Intelligence Center. Response:[response] All documents, procedures, training materials, charts, statistics, reports, and audits provided to the BPD by the Massachusetts Commonwealth Fusion Center and/or the Boston Regional Intelligence Center relating to: “Violent extremism” or “countering violent extremism.” “Islam,” “radical Islam,” radical Islamic terrorism,” “sharia,” or “jihad.” Counterterrorism investigations and intelligence operations.

Based on data we have already received from 98 law enforcement agencies, it is our understanding that agencies maintain detailed, usually electronic, records about firearms that, while under the control and/or in the possession of their employees, went missing, were lost or stolen, or are otherwise accounted for. Therefore we request the following: In a spreadsheet compatible format, such as .csv, . txt, or .xls, please provide a record of any and all agency-issued firearms that were lost, stolen, went missing or are otherwise accounted for, between the dates January 1, 2010 to the present. If your agency does not issue firearms, then we ask that the record highlight any and all firearms that were lost, stolen, went missing or otherwise became unaccounted for while under the control and/or in the possession of one of your employees. The record should include, but not be limited to, the following: · The make, model, serial number, and caliber of each lost or stolen firearm · The city where the firearm was lost or stolen · The date of the loss or theft · The date the lost or theft was reported · Name of the officer to whom the firearm was assigned · Whether each lost or stolen firearm was recovered · If the lost or stolen firearm was recovered, the date and location of the recovery · If the lost or stolen firearm was recovered, the crime or incident that the firearm was recovered through · A description of how the firearm was lost or stolen or, at minimum, an indication of whether the firearm was labelled as stolen, lost, or missing · Whether negligence on the part of the employee is/was suspected in the loss or theft of the firearm · Whether the employee was in any way disciplined for the loss or theft of the firearm Please be sure that the serial number column is pre-formatted as “Text” in Excel to preserve leading zeros. This has been an issue with numerous other departments. Excel automatically deletes leading zeros from entries containing only numerical values when the column is not formatted properly. It will, for example, turn a serial number that is actually 012345 to 12345 if the column is formatted as “General” or “Number,” for instance. The column must be pre-formatted as ""Text"" prior to inputting the data in order to avoid this issue. In addition to producing this information in spreadsheet compatible format (or if your agency is unable to provide a spreadsheet compatible format), we request that you supply copies, preferably in .pdf format, of any and all individual records pertaining to the lost, missing, and stolen firearms, including but not limited to: · Police reports, disciplinary records, memos, internal affairs investigations, inventory reports, emails or other correspondence, and/or any other records pertaining to the lost, missing, and stolen firearms"
