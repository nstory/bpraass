Hi Sgt. Boyle, Thanks for getting back to me. I’m hoping to get a copy of the 911 dispatch audio from April 19,
2013 around 7:00pm. That’s when BPD Superintendent Bill Evans was at 67 Franklin Street, Watertown where
he got word the suspect was hiding in a boat. He says 10 minutes later he heard 911 dispatch say they’re
hearing communications the guy’s in the boat but Evans says he and other BPD officers were already there,
they were waiting on tactical team, and he radio back “Yankee C3 I have the guy in the boat. So disregard the
call.“ He says within several minutes of that call we’ll likely be able to hear him yelling for officers, he says self-
reported to the scene, to hold their fire. Could we get a copy of that transmission please? Thank you so very
much, Susan
